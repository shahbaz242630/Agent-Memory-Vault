# Memory Vault — Build Handoff

**Current version:** V0.2 Closed Beta (BRD §6.2 — sleep consolidator, boundaries hardening, cross-device sync, 30 beta users)

**Last updated:** 2026-06-27 (session 15) — **🔗 GRAPH STALE-LINK REWRITE (ADR-SEC-002 Part 2, step 1) — relationships now carry `source_memory_id` provenance and the consolidator retires an edge when its source fact stops being current (content changed / merged away / contradiction-retired). Kills the obsolete-edge-lives-forever bug — the correctness precondition for ever reading the graph at answer time. Local DoD GREEN (build 0-warn / test 0-failed across vault-core 56 + vault-storage 293 + vault-consolidator 152 / clippy 0 / fmt clean); READY TO COMMIT, CI not yet verified. NEXT = measure Phi-4 extraction completeness, then GATE the read-path wiring. See §1 + ADR-SEC-002 Part 2.** **PRIOR (session 14):** **🔒 GRAPH ENCRYPTED AT REST (ADR-SEC-002) — the last plaintext store is now sealed; full CLEAN COLD DoD GREEN; ready to commit.** The DuckDB graph (`graph.duckdb`, the only store written plaintext on disk) now runs IN-MEMORY and persists as a single sealed snapshot blob (`graph.sealed`) via the same XChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope that seals LanceDB — no plaintext graph file, ever (BRD §11.12). `flush()` wired into the consolidator's enrichment pass (the graph's only writer); legacy plaintext auto-migrated + deleted on first open; wrong-key/tamper fail closed (SP-4). **Companion fix:** moving in-memory removed the DuckDB exclusive-file-lock that incidentally enforced single-daemon-per-vault, so an explicit `.vault.lock` (ADR-SEC-002 D4) now guards ALL THREE long-lived vault commands (daemon, mcp serve, consolidate run). Full clean cold DoD GREEN (build 0-warn / test 0-failed / clippy `-D warnings` 0 / fmt clean); the throwaway feasibility spike was retired (the real security tests in `graph_store.rs` supersede it). CI not yet verified (next session). See §1 + ADR-SEC-002. **PRIOR (session 13):** **🎯 MULTI-AGENT DAEMON PROVEN LIVE (ADR-SEC-001) — the locked product-goal "turn our product into a multi-agent product" is DEMONSTRATED FOR REAL.** Finding F CI was RED on first push (`28122084348`) from the SAME ubuntu-runner disk-exhaustion as the daemon commit (`No space left on device`, not a code defect — Windows+macOS build+test, all 3 clippy legs, fmt all GREEN); a plain re-run (`gh run rerun --failed`) went GREEN — the disk margin is luck-of-the-draw thin (NEXT-TIME FIX parked: mirror the Windows `D:` pattern on Linux — point `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at the ~74 GB `/mnt` ephemeral disk; do it the next time CI flakes on disk, not pre-emptively). Then the **TWO-AGENT DOGFOOD** ran end-to-end. **Layer 1 (deterministic):** `cargo test -p vault-app --test concurrent_multiagent_stage_b -- --ignored` = **1 passed** (two agents write concurrently through one daemon over real HTTP → real SQLCipher+LanceDB+DuckDB survive: audit chain intact, no lost writes, all retrievable) + `cargo test -p vault-mcp --test daemon_auth` = **3 passed** (valid token scopes to its boundaries; missing + forged tokens denied before the adapter). **Layer 2 (LIVE, real `vault-cli daemon` binary + real on-disk vault `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-tiny`):** registered `agent-a→personal` + `agent-b→work` via `vault-cli agent add` (auto-migrated the Jun-11 vault to add the agent-tokens table; tokens minted, only hashes stored); started the daemon (loopback `127.0.0.1:8765`, hands-off keychain unlock, BGE+reranker loaded); drove BOTH agents concurrently as real HTTP MCP clients (curl, streamable-HTTP + bearer tokens) and proved: (1) A writes to `personal` ✅ / A writes to `work` → `-32001 access denied` ✅ (cross-boundary WRITE denied live); (2) B writes to `work` ✅; (3) READ ISOLATION both ways — A's searches only ever return the personal fact, B's only the work fact, the other boundary's fact id NEVER appears (memory_search returns in-scope candidates, not abstain — out-of-scope facts are simply never candidates); (4) AUTH GATE live — no-token + forged-token tool calls both → `-32001 access denied`; (5) SINGLE-INSTANCE GUARD — a 2nd daemon on the same vault fails (`graph.duckdb ... used by another process ... PID 13720` → generic `authentication failed`). Daemon + keep-awake torn down clean. **The multi-agent arc is now both unit-pinned AND live-proven — DONE.** Nothing committed this session (verification-only; no code change). **PRIOR (session 12):** **FINDING F FIXED: topic-clustering giant-component collapse at 1k → reciprocal (mutual) k-NN edges (ADR-085), FULL DoD GREEN.** `topic_edges` now keeps a topic edge only when two facts are MUTUAL near-neighbours (each in the other's top-5), killing the one-way bridge edges whose transitive closure had welded 629/651 (~97%) facts into one catch-all topic. Display-only (zero read-path risk — REPORT labels are shown to the agent but topic membership never gates recall/rank). Read-precision gaps (salary/cat-breed traps) founder-confirmed LEFT TO THE AGENT — no new abstain gates. Also this session: the daemon commit `4174c4c` CI was RED from ubuntu DISK EXHAUSTION (not code); fixed in ci.yml (`a21c3af`, tool-cache + debuginfo shrink). See §1 + ADR-085. **PRIOR (session 11):** **MULTI-AGENT DAEMON ARC (ADR-SEC-001) BUILT + FULL DoD GREEN on a fresh cold build; COMMITTED `4174c4c`.** The locked multi-agent daemon arc (all 6 build steps: agent capability-token store + migration 0007, `vault-cli agent add/list/set-boundaries/revoke`, the loopback `DaemonServer` + `vault-cli daemon` subcommand with per-request `Authorization: Bearer` token→boundary scoping, audit `actor_name` attribution, security tests) is built and green. A `cargo clean` → fresh cold DoD (build **0 warnings** / test **0 failed, 0 warnings** / clippy **0 warnings** / fmt clean) surfaced + fixed two latent issues a warm tree had hidden, both in `crates/vault-storage/src/agent_token_store.rs`: a `&&str`→`*n` deref in a test helper, and a `redundant_closure` lint in `decode_agent_row` (`.map(Boundary::new)`). NEXT SESSION (see §1): verify CI green on this commit, then the **live two-agent dogfood** — the product-goal proof. **PRIOR (session 9):** **A1 COLD ARCHIVE (ADR-084, §8.16) BUILT + FULL DoD GREEN; committed `12342ed`.** Cold archive is the structural anti-bloat tool the ADR-083 "keep when unsure" posture leans on: a fact untouched past `archive_after_days` (365) gets a soft `archived_at` marker (migration 0006) that drops it OUT of default retrieval while keeping it fully intact + searchable via `include_archived` — reversible, no new crypto path (stays in the SQLCipher vault.db; founder chose soft-state over the BRD's literal separate-blob store). Phase 4 second half now wired (`phases/archive.rs` + `archive_memories()`); `memories_archived` returns the real count. fmt/clippy/build/test all GREEN (test: 0 failed incl. the real-BGE `archive_integration` E2E + the three-state no-memory-lost property). Mid-session the test gate filled the disk (link.exe 1201) → full `cargo clean` (reclaimed 180.8 GB) → clean cold re-run went green. See §1 + §8.16. **PRIOR (session 8):** contradiction over-retention guard (ADR-083, §8.15) shipped `e13348e`, CI green (run `27859912233`). The session-7 "cosine-prune the 1k bottleneck" opener was INVESTIGATED + KILLED by two measurement probes: the floor is already 0.70+top-K, can't safely rise past 0.82 (real Tesla/Rivian contradiction lives there), and the ≥0.92 "near-dups" are DISTINCT facts (Sam vs Aisha) the merge gate is right to keep — so the 1,904-pair count is a **synthetic-test-data artifact**, not a defect, with **no safe speed fix** (deferred as a one-time backfill cost). The real fix it surfaced: the contradiction judge over-retired distinct-but-similar facts (Finding B) → taught Phi-4 **single-valued-attribute (update→supersede) vs distinct-event (accumulate→keep both)**; real-Phi-4 verified clear events kept + clear updates retired. **Founder posture locked: "keep when unsure" + demote-not-delete (decay + cold-archive A1 + reranker) for bloat — A1 is the next build.** See §1 + §8.15. (Admin edit → rides with this session's code commit.)

## 1 · 🟢 NEXT SESSION OPENER — 🔗 GRAPH STALE-LINK REWRITE DONE (ADR-SEC-002 Part 2, step 1); local DoD GREEN, READY TO COMMIT; NEXT = measure extraction quality, then GATE read-path wiring

> ### ▶️ START HERE — current state (2026-06-27, session 15 close)
> **Just built (ADR-SEC-002 Part 2, step 1 — the stale-links fix), local DoD GREEN, READY TO COMMIT (nothing committed yet this session):** relationships now carry `source_memory_id` provenance, and the consolidator retires an edge when its source fact stops being current — content changed (re-extracted), merged away, or contradiction-retired. This kills the bug where an obsolete fact's edges (e.g. `user —works_at→ Acme` after the fact became Globex) lived in the graph forever — the correctness blocker for ever trusting the graph in answers. Full detail + ADR in the session-15 block just below.
>   - **Local DoD GREEN:** build `--workspace` **0 warnings** (18m, low-disk `line-tables-only`) · `cargo test -p vault-core -p vault-storage -p vault-consolidator` **0 failed** (56 / 293 / 152 + all integration suites, incl. the new provenance/retire/reconciliation tests) · clippy `--workspace --all-targets -D warnings` **0** · fmt clean. CI not yet verified (commit first).
>
> **DO FIRST next session — (a)** confirm CI green on Part-1 commit `684786f` if not already (`gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` → run `28279066201` was `success` at session-14 close — likely already green). **(b)** Commit + push this session's Part-2 step-1 work, then verify ITS CI green across `[ubuntu, windows, macos]` (ubuntu disk flake → `gh run rerun --failed`).
>
> **THEN — finish ADR-SEC-002 Part 2 (the gate sequence):**
>   1. **Measure Phi-4 extraction completeness** (no new prod code — run the `#[ignore]` real-Phi-4 probes `real_phi4_combined_extraction_quality` / `real_phi4_alias_quality` in `enrich.rs` on a seeded corpus; score entity + relationship precision/recall). This is the **number that gates step 2**.
>   2. **⚠️ GATED — wire graph traversal into the read/answer path** ONLY if step 1 clears a quality bar. If it doesn't, harden extraction first. Do NOT switch the graph into answers before that bar — an unreliable graph would hurt the answer quality that IS the product. The stale-links fix (this session) is a *precondition* for this, now satisfied.
>
> **Other arcs (founder's choice, all secondary to finishing Part 2):** A1 + ADR-083 contradiction live dogfood (closes Findings B/E) · 10k full-sweep scale run (opportunistic). **Deferred:** read-precision gaps (LEFT TO THE AGENT) · cross-device sync (until paying users).
>
> **Already SHIPPED — the engine (all green + committed):** local encrypted storage (SQLite/SQLCipher + sealed LanceDB + sealed graph) · write+retrieval pipeline (BGE embed + Qwen3 reranker) · boundaries (mandatory access control) · sleep consolidator (merge / contradiction / decay / scheduling / checkpoint+rollback / REPORT, incremental) · A1 cold archive · graph entity/relationship extraction **+ now stale-link retirement** · **multi-agent daemon (ADR-SEC-001) — built + live-proven** · MCP stdio + daemon HTTP, cross-agent proven (Claude / Cursor / Codex). The graph is built + self-cleaning but **NOT yet read at answer time** (gated, above).
>
> **Biggest gap to BETA (NOT started):** the desktop-app UI + installer + onboarding — the "product wrapper." The engine is ready; real users need a way to open it. (See §5 roadmap.)

> ### 🆕 2026-06-27 (session 15) — GRAPH STALE-LINK REWRITE (ADR-SEC-002 Part 2, step 1). Local DoD GREEN; READY TO COMMIT (CI not yet verified).
> **What shipped — the merge-path relationship rewrite (stale-links fix).** The graph extracted entity/relationship edges at consolidation but never retired them when a fact stopped being current, because edges had no link back to their source memory. Fix = add `source_memory_id` provenance + retire-on-change, all inside the enrichment pass (the graph's sole writer, ADR-SEC-002 Part 1 — keeps the sealed-snapshot flush co-located).
>   - **vault-core** (`entity.rs`): `Relationship` gains `source_memory_id: Option<MemoryId>` (None only for legacy rows); `try_new` takes it. Serde round-trip test for provenance.
>   - **vault-storage** (`graph_store.rs` + `migrations_graph/0002`): nullable `source_memory_id` BLOB column + index; carried through create / supersede / traverse / snapshot dump+restore. New `GraphStore::retire_relationships_for_memory(id) -> usize` (sets `valid_until = now` on live edges for that memory; idempotent; never matches legacy NULL). Backward-compat: old Part-1 sealed snapshots deserialise the missing field as `None` (`#[serde(default)]`); a legacy plaintext `graph.duckdb` is migrated to schema 0002 (column added NULL) before import. New tests: provenance round-trips create→traverse + seal→reopen; retirement targets only the right fact's live edges + is idempotent.
>   - **vault-consolidator** (`consolidator.rs::enrich_facts` + `phases/extract.rs`, `phases/merge.rs`): `write_extracted_to_graph` tags every edge with its `source_memory_id`. `enrich_facts` now (a) retires a (re-)enriched fact's PRIOR edges before writing fresh ones (covers content change; no-op on first enrich; runs even when the new extraction is empty), and (b) a reconciliation pass retires every live edge whose source fact left the active set (merged-away superseded originals + contradiction-retired facts). New `EnrichmentReport.relationships_retired` count. The stale "graph update deferred to T0.2.x" WARN in `apply_merge` is removed (its test replaced). Two end-to-end tests: content-change retirement + merge-supersession reconciliation.
> **DoD (incremental, low-disk `CARGO_PROFILE_{DEV,TEST}_DEBUG=line-tables-only` to keep `target/` ~42 GB instead of ~160 GB):** build `--workspace` 0 warnings (18m26s) · `cargo test -p vault-core -p vault-storage -p vault-consolidator` 0 failed (vault-core 56 / vault-storage 293 / vault-consolidator 152 + integration suites) · clippy `--workspace --all-targets -D warnings` 0 (16m) · fmt clean.
> **▶️ NEXT:** commit + push + verify CI, then **measure Phi-4 extraction completeness** (the gate for wiring graph into the read path — see §1). A known minor follow-up: un-archiving a fact (ADR-084) does NOT restore its retired edges (content unchanged → no re-enrichment trigger); harmless while the graph is out of the read path, revisit at read-path wiring.
>
> #### 🔒 ADR-SEC-002 Part 2 (LOCKED 2026-06-27) — Relationship provenance + stale-link retirement (the merge-path rewrite)
> **Context.** Graph edges are extracted at consolidation (tech-debt #2, shipped earlier) but were never retired when their source fact stopped being current — a fact whose content changed (re-extracted), was merged away, or was contradiction-retired left its old edges live forever. Edges had no provenance back to a memory, so the obsolete ones couldn't be found to retire. This is THE correctness blocker for trusting the graph in the read path (the Part 2 read-path gate).
> **Decision.** Add `source_memory_id` to every relationship (core type + graph migration 0002, nullable for legacy rows). The enrichment pass — the graph's sole writer (Part 1) — enforces "an edge is live iff its source fact is in the current active set" via:
> - **D1 — retire-before-rewrite.** Before writing a (re-)enriched fact's fresh edges, retire that memory's prior live edges. No-op on first enrichment; clears stale on content change; runs even when the new extraction is empty (a fact that lost all entities must still shed its edges).
> - **D2 — reconciliation pass.** After the enrich loop, retire every live edge whose source fact is no longer in the active set — covers merged-away superseded originals and contradiction-retired facts (which are never re-enriched, so D1 can't see them). Idempotent: a fact retired in a prior run retires 0 now, so steady-state work is near-zero.
> - **D3 — primitive `retire_relationships_for_memory(id) -> usize`.** Sets `valid_until = now` on live edges where `source_memory_id` matches; idempotent; never matches legacy NULL rows. History preserved (bi-temporal, same posture as `supersede_relationship`) — nothing deleted.
> - **D4 — all graph mutation stays in the enrichment pass**, NOT in `merge.rs` / `contradiction.rs`. Keeps the sealed-snapshot flush co-located with the only writer (Part 1). `apply_merge` just marks originals superseded; the reconciliation does the graph half.
> **Backward-compat.** Old Part-1 sealed snapshots (no field) deserialise with `None` (`#[serde(default)]`); a legacy plaintext `graph.duckdb` is migrated to schema 0002 before its rows are imported.
> **Scope = step 1 of Part 2 (self-cleaning graph).** The read-path wiring (Part 2 final) stays GATED on measured extraction completeness — do not wire the graph into answers before that bar.
> **Known follow-up (parked, harmless while graph is out of the read path).** Un-archiving a fact (ADR-084) does not restore its retired edges — un-archive doesn't change content, so no re-enrichment fires. Revisit when the graph enters the read path.
> **Alternatives rejected.** Retire at the merge/contradiction sites (splits graph writes across files, breaks the Part-1 "enrichment is the sole writer + flush" co-location). A single bulk `NOT IN (active_ids)` reconciliation UPDATE (huge IN-list at scale; the per-fact idempotent loop is simpler + cheap since steady-state retires 0). Hard-deleting obsolete edges (loses bi-temporal history; violates the retire-not-delete posture).

> ### 🆕 2026-06-27 (session 14) — GRAPH ENCRYPTED AT REST (ADR-SEC-002 Part 1). Full clean cold DoD GREEN; READY TO COMMIT (CI not yet verified).
> **What shipped — ADR-SEC-002 Part 1 (encrypt the graph at rest).** The DuckDB graph was the only store written plaintext on disk. Fix: run it IN-MEMORY, persist as a single sealed snapshot blob (`graph.sealed`) via the existing dryoc XChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope, keyed by the same `at_rest_key` as LanceDB. Wrong key / tamper → fail closed (SP-4).
>   - **vault-storage** (`graph_store.rs`): `open_with_at_rest_key` (in-memory + load sealed snapshot) · `open_ephemeral` (tests) · `flush` as a `GraphStore` trait method (default no-op for mocks; sealed override snapshots→seals→atomic-writes) · raw-row snapshot/restore (exact fidelity incl. bi-temporal + blob-id columns) · one-time legacy-plaintext migration (import then delete `graph.duckdb`) · plaintext WARN + its test removed. `cascading.rs`: `StorageBackend::flush_graph()` passthrough + key plumbed to the graph open (was already in scope). 4 new security tests (round-trip-across-reopen · no-plaintext-on-disk + no-plaintext-file · wrong-key-fails-closed · legacy-migration) + all 46 existing graph tests still green.
>   - **vault-consolidator** (`consolidator.rs`): `self.storage.flush_graph()` at the end of `enrich_facts` (the graph's only writer) — covers CLI `consolidate run`, the app scheduler, and headless `schedule`. Best-effort (logged, not fatal — derived data).
>   - **Companion single-instance fix (ADR-SEC-002 D4):** in-memory removed the DuckDB exclusive-file-lock that incidentally blocked a 2nd daemon. Restored with an explicit `.vault.lock` (generalized `ConsolidatorLock::try_acquire_named` + `VAULT_LOCKFILE_NAME` in `vault-app`) acquired by ALL THREE long-lived vault commands — `daemon`, `mcp serve`, `consolidate run` (`vault-cli/main.rs`), held for the command's lifetime (RAII). Daemon docstring (was "no separate lockfile needed") corrected.
>   - **Spike retired:** the `graph_seal_spike.rs` feasibility spike (proved the mechanism pre-build) was deleted — the real security tests supersede it (its docstring said "remove/promote when ADR-SEC-002 lands").
> **DoD: full CLEAN COLD pass GREEN** (`cargo clean` → 187 GB free → fresh from-scratch): build `--workspace --all-targets` 0 warnings · `cargo test -p vault-storage -p vault-app -p vault-consolidator -p vault-cli` **0 failed** · clippy `--workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 · fmt clean. Post-cold the spike was removed; clippy `--all-targets` (compiles the test code) + fmt re-green confirm the deletion — the test-EXEC re-run tripped on **DISK EXHAUSTION at ~2 GB free, NOT code** (`target/` had ballooned to ~197 GB across the build+test+clippy passes → `cargo clean` reclaimed it, 184 GB free). **PROCESS LESSON:** running build + test + clippy `--all-targets` back-to-back ~doubles `target/`; clean between heavy passes next cold DoD.
> **▶️ NEXT SESSION:** (1) **verify CI green** on this commit (`gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` → `success` across the `[ubuntu, windows, macos]` matrix) — local cold DoD = founder's Windows, CI = clean-room. (2) Then either **ADR-SEC-002 Part 2** (finish the graph FEATURE: merge-path relationship rewrite + measure/harden extraction completeness, then GATE wiring graph traversal into the read/answer path on a proven quality bar — do NOT switch it on before that bar; forcing an unreliable graph into answers would hurt the answer quality that IS the product) OR pick a parked arc (A1+ADR-083 contradiction dogfood · 10k scale · read-precision left-to-agent). Sync DEFERRED until paying users.
> **Minor follow-up parked:** optional daemon-shutdown `flush_graph()` safety net (low value — graph only changes at consolidation, which already flushes) · the Linux CI `/mnt` disk fix (session 13).
>
> #### 🔒 ADR-SEC-002 (LOCKED 2026-06-27) — Encrypt the DuckDB graph at rest: in-memory + sealed snapshot
> **Context.** The graph store was the only store written plaintext on disk (BRD §11.12 "no plaintext data on disk, ever"). DuckDB has no pluggable I/O layer, so the LanceDB `vault-sealed://` ObjectStoreProvider approach doesn't apply (§11.5.1 confirms); DuckDB native encryption needs a per-platform crypto extension loaded offline (documented dead-end — ADR-078 / tech-debt #7). §11.5.1 left this open "to be answered at the vault-graph integration task," naming a sealed-snapshot scheme as candidate (a).
> **Decision.** Run the graph IN-MEMORY; persist as a single sealed snapshot blob (`<graph>.sealed`) via the existing dryoc XChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope (`seal_file_bytes`/`unseal_file_bytes`), keyed by the vault `at_rest_key` (K3-derived; same as LanceDB). Snapshot = raw rows → `serde_json` → seal → atomic write; restore = unseal → load into a fresh in-memory DuckDB. AAD = `blake3("vault-graph-snapshot-v1")` (domain-separated from LanceDB's `"vault-at-rest-v1"`).
> - **D1 — In-memory engine.** Nothing on disk in plaintext, ever. No temp files, no per-OS RAM-disk tricks. Feasibility proven by a compile-and-run spike (now retired) reusing the real envelope.
> - **D2 — `flush()` cadence = end of each consolidator enrichment pass** (the graph's only writer). Rejected flush-on-every-write (O(writes×size) reseal at scale).
> - **D3 — Derived-data durability.** A crash between flushes loses at most deltas since the last flush; the graph re-extracts from memories next run. "No memory ever lost" holds — memories live durably in SQLite + LanceDB.
> - **D4 — Companion vault-owner lock.** In-memory removed the DuckDB exclusive-file-lock that incidentally enforced single-daemon-per-vault. Restored with an explicit `.vault.lock` (`ConsolidatorLock::try_acquire_named`, RAII) acquired by `daemon`, `mcp serve`, AND `consolidate run` — at most one long-lived vault owner at a time.
> - **D5 — One-time migration.** A legacy plaintext `graph.duckdb` is imported then deleted on first open.
> **§11.12 vault-storage checklist now satisfied:** "LanceDB and DuckDB files encrypted at filesystem layer" ✅ (both) · "No plaintext data on disk, ever" ✅ (graph was the last gap).
> **Alternatives rejected.** DuckDB native encryption (per-platform extension + supply-chain surface); decrypt-to-temp-file (plaintext at runtime); `EXPORT DATABASE` to a folder (multi-file + plaintext temp dir).
> **Scope = Part 1 (encryption) ONLY.** Part 2 (finish the graph FEATURE + wire it into the read/answer path) stays gated until extraction completeness is measured + hardened.

> ### 🆕 2026-06-26 (session 13) — MULTI-AGENT DAEMON PROVEN LIVE (product-goal demonstrated). Verification-only, nothing committed.
> **Finding F CI:** first push red from ubuntu-runner disk exhaustion (`No space left on device` — infra, not code; every other leg green); a plain `gh run rerun --failed` went GREEN (run `28122084348`). The disk margin on the ubuntu build+test leg is razor-thin. **PARKED next-time fix (do NOT do pre-emptively):** mirror the Windows `D:\t` pattern on Linux — set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to the ~74 GB `/mnt` ephemeral disk instead of squeezing GBs off root; apply the next time CI flakes on disk.
> **Two-agent dogfood — ALL GREEN (see line-5 summary for the full blow-by-blow):**
>   - **Layer 1 (deterministic):** `concurrent_multiagent_stage_b` (vault-app, `--ignored`) = 1 passed — concurrent two-agent writes through one daemon leave the real three stores intact (audit chain, no lost writes, retrievable). `daemon_auth` (vault-mcp) = 3 passed — valid-token scoping + missing/forged-token denial over the real HTTP transport.
>   - **Layer 2 (LIVE, real binary + real on-disk vault):** daemon on `seeded-vault-tiny`, two agents (`personal`/`work`), driven concurrently via curl streamable-HTTP + bearer tokens. Proved live: own-boundary write ✅, cross-boundary write denied (`-32001`) ✅, read isolation both directions (other boundary's fact never a candidate) ✅, auth gate (no/forged token → `-32001`) ✅, single-instance guard (2nd daemon can't open the locked vault) ✅.
>   - **Verdict:** ADR-SEC-001 is unit-pinned AND live-proven. The locked "turn our product into a multi-agent product" goal is DONE.
> **▶️ NEXT SESSION — pick the next arc (all were SECONDARY/parked behind the daemon; founder to choose):** (1) A1 + ADR-083 contradiction live dogfood (closes carried Findings B/E at a real run, proves the bloat-control story); (2) 10k full-sweep scale run (opportunistic); (3) read-precision gaps — founder-confirmed LEFT TO THE AGENT, no new abstain gates (see session-12 block). **Sync stays DEFERRED until paying users.** Optional housekeeping: the dogfood left 2 agent tokens + 2 marker facts in throwaway `seeded-vault-tiny` (safe to wipe).

> ### 2026-06-24 (session 12) — Finding F FIXED (ADR-085, DoD green) + daemon CI disk-fix pushed

> ### 🆕 2026-06-24 (session 12) — FINDING F FIXED: topic clustering collapse → reciprocal (mutual) k-NN (ADR-085). FULL DoD GREEN. Read-precision gaps: founder-confirmed LEFT TO THE AGENT (no code).
> **What shipped (vault-consolidator/src/topics.rs only).** The 1k topic collapse (629/651 ≈ 97% in one catch-all topic, 2026-06-21 scale run) was a **giant-component percolation** bug: `topic_edges` added a topic edge whenever fact `j` was in fact `i`'s top-5 (≥0.70) — a *one-way* edge — and `union_find_components` takes the transitive closure, so a single weak bridge link welds unrelated topics; at 1k those bridges are everywhere. **Fix = require edges to be MUTUAL** (keep `(i,j)` only if `j ∈ topK(i)` AND `i ∈ topK(j)`) — the standard reciprocal-kNN sparsification. Floor unchanged (0.70); the fix is the graph rule, not a threshold tweak. **Display-only, zero read-path risk** — REPORT topic labels ARE shown to the agent per fact, but retrieval+rerank decide what surfaces/rank, NOT topic membership ([[project_report_topics_shown_to_agent_but_dont_gate_recall]]). See ADR-085 below.
> **DoD GREEN (incremental, warm tree, 92.5 GB free).** build `--workspace` 0 warnings (6m) · `cargo test -p vault-consolidator` **150 passed, 0 failed** (incl. new `discover_topics_mutual_knn_drops_one_way_bridge_edges` + all 10 existing topic tests still green) · clippy `--workspace --all-targets -D warnings` 0 (21s) · fmt clean.
> **Read-precision gaps — RESOLVED AS "no code needed" (founder 2026-06-24).** The salary→$6,500-booking and cat-breed→golden-retriever traps are LEFT TO THE AGENT (the trust-the-agent posture: the agent sees the returned facts + judges; adding a stricter abstain gate is exactly the over-tightening that wrecks recall). The "where do you live"→"relocated" paraphrase miss already has its shipped mitigation (alias-enrichment, ADR-074); further tuning needs a live read test, not a blind tweak. **Do not add read-time abstain gates for these.**
> **▶️ NEXT SESSION:** (1) verify CI green on the latest commit(s) — `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` → `success` across `[ubuntu, windows, macos]`; the ubuntu disk fix (below) + Finding F both need to land green. (2) Then the **LIVE TWO-AGENT DOGFOOD** (§ daemon block below) — the multi-agent product-goal proof. (3) Optional: a one-time empirical probe embedding the real seeded-1k vault to *show* the blob splitting under mutual-kNN (deferred — the mechanism is unit-pinned + the root cause was confirmed by code read; run it if we want the before/after number).
>
> #### 🔒 ADR-085 (LOCKED 2026-06-24) — Topic clustering: reciprocal (mutual) k-NN edges to fix giant-component collapse at scale (Finding F)
> **Context.** ADR-068 topic discovery builds a cosine-similarity graph (each fact's top-[`TOPIC_NN_TOP_K`]=5 neighbours at/above [`TOPIC_NN_SIMILARITY_FLOOR`]=0.70) then groups by connected components (`union_find_components`, transitive closure). The 2026-06-21 1k scale run collapsed **629/651 (~97%) into one catch-all topic** (vs a healthy spread at 100). Root cause (confirmed by code read, not hypothesised): one-way top-K edges + transitive closure → a single barely-above-floor bridge link welds two unrelated topics; as N grows those bridges proliferate and a giant connected component emerges (Erdős–Rényi percolation).
> **Decision.** Require topic edges to be **reciprocal**: keep `(i,j)` only when `j` is in `i`'s top-K AND `i` is in `j`'s top-K. Standard mutual-kNN graph sparsification — drops the one-way bridges, keeps genuinely-related clusters intact (mutual pairs survive), stays deterministic, O(N²) cosine + O(N·K) reciprocity. Implemented as a two-pass `topic_edges` (build each fact's directed top-K set, then keep only mutual pairs).
> **Scope = display-only.** Topic membership never gates read-time recall or rank; the REPORT's topic *labels* are surfaced to the agent per returned fact, but which facts surface (+ order) come from retrieval + the Qwen3 reranker. So this change carries **zero risk to recall/ranking** — it only improves the topic tags the agent sees. Aligns with the founder "don't over-tighten / trust the agent" posture.
> **Floor unchanged at 0.70** — mutual-NN is the structural fix; raising the floor was rejected (band-aid: only delays percolation to a larger N and fragments real same-subject clusters).
> **Verification.** Mechanism pinned by `discover_topics_mutual_knn_drops_one_way_bridge_edges` (6 identical hub facts + 1 outsider linked only one-way → 2 topics {6},{1}, NOT the old 1-of-7). All 10 prior topic tests still pass (they used identical=mutual or orthogonal=no-edge, so the rule is unchanged for them). Empirical 1k before/after probe deferred as optional (heavy real-BGE run).
> **Alternatives rejected.** Raise the floor (band-aid, fragments real topics). Community detection / Louvain modularity (heavier, a new algorithm for a display-only artifact — over-engineering for a two-person build). Max-component-size cap + re-split (additive complexity; not needed unless mutual-NN proves insufficient at scale — revisit only if a future empirical run shows residual collapse).
>
> #### 🅰️ Daemon CI disk-fix (committed `a21c3af`, ci.yml only — verify it + Finding F both land CI-green)
> CI on the daemon commit `4174c4c` was **failure** (run `28095804243`) — only `cargo build + test (ubuntu-latest)`; the run annotation was **`System.IO.IOException: No space left on device`** (runner killed mid-build, no compile error — clippy-ubuntu + Windows + macOS all passed, so the code is sound). The daemon arc's rmcp/hyper deps + two heavy new integration-test binaries pushed `target/` past the Linux free space. **Fix (ci.yml only):** on the ubuntu build leg add `tool-cache: true` to `jlumbroso/free-disk-space` (~8 GB) + a Linux `-C debuginfo=line-tables-only` step before rust-cache (the same proven shrink the Windows leg uses). YAML validated.

> ### 🆕 2026-06-24 (session 11) — MULTI-AGENT DAEMON ARC BUILT + FULL DoD GREEN (fresh cold build) + COMMITTED (this commit)
> **The locked concurrent-multi-agent arc (ADR-SEC-001) is DONE and shipped in this commit.** All 6 build-plan steps landed; a `cargo clean` → fresh cold DoD pass is green end-to-end.
>
> #### ✅ DONE this session
> 1. **Build pass complete** — Steps 1–6 of the ADR-SEC-001 build plan all built: agent capability-token store (`agent_token_store.rs` + migration `0007_agent_tokens.sql`, BLAKE3 `token_hash` only), `vault-cli agent add/list/set-boundaries/revoke`, the loopback `DaemonServer` (`vault-mcp/src/daemon.rs`) + `vault-cli daemon` subcommand (streamable-HTTP, single-instance lockfile, graceful key-wipe), per-request `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → hash-lookup → boundary scoping, audit `actor_name` attribution, and the security tests (`vault-mcp/tests/daemon_auth.rs`, `vault-app/tests/concurrent_multiagent_stage_b.rs`).
> 2. **Fresh cold DoD GREEN** — after a `cargo clean` (reclaimed 27 GB, cold tree, 170 GB free): `cargo build --workspace` **0 warnings** (23 min) · `cargo test -p vault-storage -p vault-mcp -p vault-app -p vault-cli` **0 failed, 0 warnings** (44 min; 288-test vault-app suite + all others green) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` **0 warnings** · `cargo fmt --all --check` clean.
> 3. **Two cold-build-surfaced fixes** (both `crates/vault-storage/src/agent_token_store.rs`, latent until a from-scratch build): `&&str`→`*n` deref in the `boundaries()` test helper (line ~261); `redundant_closure` in `decode_agent_row` → `.map(Boundary::new)` (line ~214). Re-verified `cargo test -p vault-storage` green on the final source.
> 4. **Committed** the whole arc (daemon code + both spikes + token store + ADR-SEC-001) as one batch in this commit.
>
> #### ▶️ NEXT SESSION — verify CI, then the LIVE TWO-AGENT DOGFOOD (product-goal proof)
> 1. **FIRST — verify CI green on this commit.** `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` → confirm `success` on the `[ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]` matrix. Local DoD = founder's Windows; CI = clean-room Linux+Windows; BOTH required before "shipped" (the 22-commit silent-failure trap is why). If red, read the failing job before anything else.
> 2. **THEN — live two-agent dogfood** (ADR-SEC-001 shipping seq C.3 — "turn our product into a multi-agent product" demonstrated for real): (a) optional pre-check — run the parked Stage-B test `cargo test -p vault-app --test concurrent_multiagent_stage_b -- --ignored --nocapture`; (b) start the daemon (`vault-cli daemon`, loopback — confirm exact flags via `--help`); (c) register TWO agents (`vault-cli agent add <name> --boundaries <list>`, e.g. `claude`→`personal` and a second agent with a different boundary set); (d) connect BOTH concurrently to the daemon URL via real MCP clients; (e) confirm concurrent read/write against the REAL vault + per-agent boundary scoping LIVE (agent A's allowed boundaries ≠ agent B's). Capture the result here.
> 3. **SECONDARY (parked):** A1 + ADR-083 contradiction dogfood · 10k full-sweep scale run · Finding F (topic-clustering collapses at 1k) · read-precision gaps. **Sync stays DEFERRED until paying users.**

> ## 🅰️ MULTI-AGENT DAEMON ARC — SHIPPED (ADR-SEC-001, commit `4174c4c`, live-proven session 13)
> The "one shared local vault daemon; agents connect to it, not the raw files" arc is **DONE** — it solved V0.2's single-writer constraint (concurrent agents on the same vault → LanceDB/DuckDB corruption). The daemon owns the stores; agents connect over rmcp streamable-HTTP on loopback with per-agent capability tokens + per-request boundary scoping. Built session 11, proven live session 13 (two agents, real vault, boundary isolation + auth gate + single-instance guard all confirmed). **Full design record = the ADR-SEC-001 block below (session-10 entry).** The pre-build narrative that lived here (verify-overnight-1k / problem / fix / build-plan) is removed as superseded. Connect-an-agent how-to: [[cross-agent-mcp-connection]].

> **🆕 2026-06-23 (session 10) — MULTI-AGENT DAEMON ARC OPENED. Stage-A transport spike GREEN; Stage-B real-store spike WRITTEN + PARKED (build deferred, founder call); BRD §11 re-read; ADR-SEC-001 LOCKED. Nothing committed — all spike code + this ADR are uncommitted working-tree, riding with the daemon code in a future BATCHED build pass.**
>
> ### ✅ DONE this session
> 1. **Verified CI green on `12342ed`** (A1 cold archive) — run `27889675293` = `success` on the `[ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]` matrix. A1 fully landed.
> 2. **Stage-A transport spike GREEN** — `crates/vault-mcp/tests/streamable_http_spike.rs` (2 tests, both pass; all 43 vault-mcp tests still pass). Proved rmcp 1.5.0 `StreamableHttpService` on a hyper-util loopback host: TWO rmcp HTTP clients connect to ONE daemon CONCURRENTLY and both read/write; both funnel through the ONE shared `Arc<dyn Adapter>`; the default `allowed_hosts` guard rejects a spoofed `Host` with 403. Dev-only deps (rmcp transport features + `hyper-util "=0.1.20"`, already in `Cargo.lock` → zero new crates; chose hyper-util over axum to add no supply-chain surface).
> 3. **Stage-B real-store spike WRITTEN + PARKED** — `crates/vault-app/tests/concurrent_multiagent_stage_b.rs` (`#[ignore]`). Daemon over the REAL `VaultAdapter` (real BGE + SQLCipher + LanceDB + DuckDB); two agents write 5 distinct facts each concurrently; asserts audit chain intact + no lost writes (`list_memories` == 10) + all retrievable. **NOT RUN** — Rust has no run-without-build; deferred to the batched build pass (founder: park builds, do the build-free design now).
> 4. **Re-read BRD §11 in full + §5.7** (mandated for vault-mcp security work). §5.7 already anticipates `McpTransport::HttpSse` (spec-scoped V1.1-for-remote; we pull it forward for a LOCAL multi-agent purpose — goal-locked divergence per [[feedback_goal_first_over_spec_alignment_when_goal_locked]]). §11.12 vault-mcp checklist is the target.
>
> ### 🔒 ADR-SEC-001 (LOCKED 2026-06-23) — Local multi-agent vault daemon: transport + auth + concurrency
> **Context.** V0.2 ships MCP stdio (1 client ⇒ 1 server subprocess; stdio is 1:1). Users run several agents at once; multiple server processes on the same vault files have no cross-process coordination → LanceDB optimistic-concurrency corruption + DuckDB exclusive-lock failure ([[cross-agent-mcp-connection]]). Founder locked "turn our product into a multi-agent product" (2026-06-21).
> **Decision.** One long-lived LOCAL daemon owns the three stores exclusively; agents connect over rmcp streamable-HTTP on loopback. Every write serializes through the existing `StorageBackend Mutex<Connection>` gate. The nightly consolidator runs INSIDE this one process.
> - **D1 — Transport: loopback-only streamable-HTTP.** Bind `127.0.0.1`/`::1` only; rmcp's default `allowed_hosts` enforces it (Stage A proved 403 on spoofed Host).
> - **D2 — No TLS on loopback.** Loopback never traverses the network, so TLS defends against a MITM that cannot occur here; the real local threat (malware reading process memory) is unaffected by TLS. SP-5 boring-option: loopback needs no TLS. Threat-model basis, not an omission.
> - **D3 — Capability token per connection (THE new mechanism, §11.12 box 1).** Stdio's security WAS the OS process boundary; a shared loopback door has none (any local process can connect), so loopback binding alone is insufficient. The token restores least-privilege (SP-2). Per-agent opaque 256-bit random token; the daemon stores a BLAKE3 HASH (never plaintext) mapped to {agent_name, authorized_boundaries, created_at}. Presented as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; read in the handler via rmcp `RequestContext` extensions (`http::request::Parts`, documented in rmcp `streamable_http_server::tower`). Missing/invalid/unknown → generic 401 + audit denial, no data (SP-4 fail-secure).
> - **D4 — Per-REQUEST boundary scoping (architecture change).** Today `StdioServer` holds ONE construction-time `authorized_boundaries`. The daemon resolves the boundary set PER REQUEST from the validated token → looked-up agent record. Good consequence: re-scoping an agent takes effect live (no restart, no token re-issue).
> - **D5 — Agents SHARE memory within a boundary; boundaries are the walls, not agents** (founder-confirmed 2026-06-23). Cross-agent sharing is the product thesis. Tokens scope WHICH boundaries an agent reaches; within a shared boundary, agents see each other's memories (attributed via `source_agent` + audit, not hidden).
> - **D6 — Token issuance = per-agent registration via `vault-cli`.** `vault-cli agent add --name <x> --boundaries <list>` mints a token; `agent set-boundaries` / `agent revoke` edit live. Chosen over a single shared auto-token because only per-agent records support boundary-scoping, audit attribution, and later editability.
> - **D7 — Tokens long-lived + revocable** (not auto-expiring). Local daily-use tool; instant revoke is the real control (SP-8 honored via revocation). Configurable later.
> - **D8 — Keep stdio AND add the daemon.** Stdio stays the simple single-agent default (OS-protected, no token); the daemon is opt-in for multi-agent. Shared tool handler, both transports.
> - **D9 — At-rest encryption UNCHANGED.** The daemon is a new front door to the same `StorageBackend` (SQLCipher + sealed LanceDB/DuckDB untouched); zero-knowledge posture intact. The daemon holds the unlocked vault in memory exactly as today's stdio server does.
> - **D10 — Rate limiting DEFERRED — NOT built for the local daemon (founder-agreed 2026-06-23).** §11.12's "rate limiting per client" + §11.6.2's table are cloud/multi-tenant controls: they protect shared infra + OTHER tenants from one client flooding. The local daemon is single-user — every agent is one the user registered; a runaway agent wastes only the user's own machine (noticed + stopped), there is no shared infra / other tenant to protect, and it adds nothing against a stolen token (auth + boundary scoping is THAT defense). Deferred to the Managed (cloud, per-user-vault PAYG) mode where multi-tenant abuse is real. **Do NOT re-add for the local daemon** — over-engineering for scale we don't have.
> **§11.12 vault-mcp checklist under this ADR:** Schema validation ✅(have) · Boundary check ✅(have, now per-request) · Audit every call ✅(have, + agent name) · Generic errors ✅(have) · **Capability tokens for every connection** ← D3 NEW · **Rate limiting per client** ← DEFERRED to Managed mode (D10), not built locally.
> **Alternatives rejected.** Single shared auto-token (no per-agent scoping/attribution/edit). Daemon-only/drop stdio (needless single-agent friction). axum host (hyper-util already in tree → smaller supply chain). JWT (SP-5 no crypto-DIY; opaque-random + hashed lookup is the boring option).
>
> *(The session-10 BUILD PLAN, "NEXT SESSION — THE BUILD PASS" steps, and the Uncommitted/parked checklist were removed as superseded — all 6 build steps shipped in `4174c4c` and were live-proven session 13. The ADR-SEC-001 decisions above remain as the design record.)*

> **🆕 2026-06-21 (session 9 cont.) — founder decisions + a scale pressure-test run.**
>
> 1. **🛑 Cross-device sync (`vault-sync`, Pillar 3) is DEFERRED indefinitely.** Founder call: it is the most expensive (needs paid cloud accounts — Cloudflare R2/Workers + auth), most complex, most security-sensitive surface, and building it before we have traction / paying users is backwards for a no-budget two-person bootstrap. It is a "paying users with multiple devices are asking for it" feature, NOT an early/hope-for-traction feature. **Do not propose sync as the next arc.** Groundwork already done this session (read BRD §5.8 + §11.1–§11.13; the dryoc envelope spike ADR-008 is complete). When we DO return: the right shape is offline-first — (A) crypto envelope → (B) CRDT/Yrs change model → (C) local-folder `SyncProvider` that proves zero-knowledge end-to-end in CI with no cloud/accounts → (D) real Cloudflare → (E) per-OS hardware key binding. Layers A–C are platform-agnostic pure Rust + free; D–E are the account-needing, genuinely-cross-platform-hard parts to do last.
> 2. **Live dogfood of A1 + ADR-083 — now SECONDARY** (still valuable; closes carried Findings B + E at a real run, proves the bloat-control story). Reprioritized BELOW the multi-agent arc (founder 2026-06-21); do it opportunistically, not as the opener.
> 3. **📊 Scale pressure-test (the long-owed 100/1k/10k validation) — run THIS session.** See the SCALE RESULTS block below. Goal: per-scale timing + does-the-pipeline-complete + correct-REPORT/checkpoint scorecard. Known wall: a full-sweep cold backfill is O(vault) and slow — the *incremental* nightly run is fast (that's the ADR-082 fix); the full-sweep is a one-time accepted cost.
>
> ### 📊 SCALE RESULTS (2026-06-21, no-timeout full sweeps, debug binary `12342ed`, real BGE + Phi-4)
> Seeded fresh via `scale_eval.rs seed_live_vault` (`SEED_N` + `SEED_VAULT_DIR`); ran `vault-cli consolidate run` with `VAULT_CONSOLIDATOR_TIMEOUT_SECS=0`.
> - **100 facts → ✅ PASS.** Completed end-to-end exit 0 in **~92 min wall** (internal consolidation 43 min + ~30 min one-time enrichment backfill + model load). Full pipeline ran: 2 dedups · **8 contradictions auto-resolved (recency)** · 0 archived (correct — facts not year-old) · checkpoint `019ee841-…` written · REPORT written. **Confirms the session-7 Finding A fix LIVE** — the 8 auto-retirements now surface in the summary (were hidden before). Vault: `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-100-scale`. **The no-timeout knob makes the full sweep COMPLETE — the thing that used to break is fixed.**
> - **1k facts → ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-22, exit 0, ~35 h wall-clock).** Full sweep finished on `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-scale` (pristine `seeded-vault-1k` untouched). Numbers: **1000 processed · 61 merges · 49 deduped · 260 contradictions auto-resolved · 0 archived · checkpoint `019eed66-…` written · REPORT written (200 KB, all 651 active facts).** Phase timing: merge+contradiction ≈ 21.5 h (the long pole, ~1,730 Phi-4 pairs @ ~40–80 s each on the integrated-GPU debug build), **checkpoint written at the ~21.5 h mark — BEFORE enrichment** (corrects an earlier "checkpoint only at the very end" note; ADR-081 excludes additive enrichment from rollback), then enrichment ≈ 13.5 h, then REPORT.
>   - **🔴 NEW FINDING — Finding F COLLAPSES at scale:** topic organization is near-useless at 1k — **629 of 651 facts (~97%) landed in ONE catch-all topic** (vs 57/75 at 100). The REPORT generates fine + covers every active fact, but its topic grouping doesn't scale → real work item (ties to deferred Pillar-2 Step 4 stored-vector REPORT reuse + better topic clustering). **Read path UNAFFECTED** (agent doesn't use report topics; the memory-import dogfood confirmed read correctness).
>   - **Takeaway:** full-sweep completes + is durable (35 h, zero crashes), but full-sweep is a one-time cost; the *incremental nightly* run is the product path.
> - **🟢 INCREMENTAL-on-1k test → ✅ PROVES THE PRODUCT PATH (2026-06-22).** Wrote 3 new dup/contradiction facts to the consolidated 1k vault, re-ran `consolidate run`. Result: **`incremental=true`, seed_count=24** (the 3 new + ~21 facts the full sweep itself mutated — watermark = run-start-time, a known bounded over-inclusion), **candidate_pairs=14** (vs 1,730 full-sweep), **4 contradictions retired**, **duration 13m 28s (~20 min wall) vs ~35 h full sweep → ~100× faster.** This is the nightly path real users feel: first-ever clean = 35 h one-time; every night after = minutes (and faster still on real hardware / in steady state). Note: the Rivian near-dup did NOT merge this round (strict dedup gate, known — not a failure). Scratch vault `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-scale` (consolidated + 3 extra facts) safe to wipe.
> - **🔎 Confirmation read on the live 1k vault (2026-06-22, `read_check.py`):** **Cuisine contradiction RESOLVED correctly** — "Italian" (new) returns #1 @0.999, "Japanese" (old) gone ✅. **Recall 5/5** (pet/cello/engineer/running/languages all #1 against 654 facts) ✅. Three KNOWN warts reproduced (none new/regressions): (a) **"where do you live" — the new "relocated to Berlin" fact does NOT surface** (Porto correctly retired, but the relocation-phrased winner has weak recall → vocab-gap/[[reranker-brittle-on-terse-queries]]; net edge: neither old nor new shows for that phrasing); (b) **salary did NOT abstain** ($6,500 *booking* noise — money-noise trap); (c) **cat breed did NOT abstain** (golden retriever — wrong-neighbour trap). (b)+(c) are the tracked 🟡 read-precision insurance gaps (agent-rescuable per the trust-the-agent strategy). Core (contradiction resolution + recall) confirmed at 1k; precision edges are the known ones.
> - **10k facts → ⏭️ AFTER 1k** (founder wants it). Full sweep is multi-day; founder accepts the cost. Pristine `seeded-vault-10k` on disk.
>
> ### 🧪 MEMORY-IMPORT DOGFOOD (2026-06-21) — Claude's own memories → vault → read back; ran LIVE alongside the 1k (separate fresh vault, BGE+reranker only, no Phi-4, RAM watched)
> Imported **15 of Claude's own memory-vault-project memories** as atomic facts via the real MCP `memory_write`, then read them back via `memory_read`. Harness `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\memimport_test.py`; throwaway vault `C:\Projects\vault-memimport-test`. Answers the founder's "is the product worth it" question on real, self-supplied knowledge.
> - **Writes: 15/15 saved.** ✅
> - **Recall: 6/8 returned the exact right fact at rank #1 (conf 0.99+).** 1 wobble (Q3 "before a cargo build": right fact at #2, a sibling cargo fact at #1). **1 false-abstain (Q5 "what's the next feature we're building?": the answer was present at #2 but the read abstained at reranker score 0.143).**
> - **Abstain: 2/2 correct** on genuinely-absent facts (favourite food 0.005, billing DB 0.0002) — **zero hallucinations.**
> - **Clean score separation:** correct = 0.99+, absent = 0.000x; the false-abstain (0.14) is the *calibration* gap, not a recall gap — the fact was still RETURNED in the list (recall-safety held), only the abstain FLAG was wrong.
> - **Q5 reproduces the known reranker brittleness** ([[reranker-brittle-on-terse-queries]] / [[1k-live-read-false-abstain]]) on CLEAN, well-phrased data → a concrete repro for that hardening work.
> - **Takeaway (founder lesson 2026-06-21):** core value (atomic knowledge in → correct fact out + honest abstain) WORKS live. The save contract must be STRICT — agents save **atomic facts**, NEVER dump whole BRDs / long chats / long documents: BGE-small truncates embeddings at 512 tokens (~2000 chars), so a dumped doc is ~95% invisible to search. **Verified current state (`vault-mcp/src/server.rs`):** the `memory_write` tool description ALREADY encodes the 6 canonical rules incl. rule #1 "Atomic facts. One fact per memory. Split compound statements into multiple writes," AND "WHEN NOT TO CALL" already excludes conversation history — so we are NOT exposed. **The only incremental hardening** = add ONE explicit line for the big-document case (e.g. rule #7: "Decompose documents — if the user shares a long BRD/spec/chat, extract its facts and save each separately; never store a whole document as one memory"). Small description-string edit → needs a rebuild + DoD gates → **bundle with the multi-agent arc** (touches `vault-mcp` anyway) or a quick standalone edit+gate once the 1k frees the machine. A full document-ingestion (chunk→extract) feature is a separate future build. See [[project_mcp_descriptions_cross_platform_lever]].

> **🆕 2026-06-21 (session 9) — A1 COLD ARCHIVE (ADR-084, §8.16) BUILT + FULL DoD GREEN on a fresh cold build + COMMITTED + PUSHED (`12342ed`). CI `in_progress` at session close (run `27889675293`, ~57 min matrix — verify green first thing). The anti-bloat tool the "keep when unsure" posture leans on.**
>
> ### ✅ DONE this session
> 1. **Built A1 cold archive (ADR-084, §8.16).** Soft `Memory.archived_at` state (migration 0006 + partial index) — a fact untouched past `archive_after_days` (365) gets the marker in Phase 4 (`phases/archive.rs` `plan_archive` + `Consolidator::archive_memories()` + `StorageBackend::apply_archive` + `memory.archived` audit event), dropping OUT of default retrieval while staying intact + searchable via `include_archived`. `memories_archived` now returns the real count; summary "Archived: N" live. Retrieval extends the existing non-current bucket (superseded + expired + **archived**). Checkpoint diff reads both snapshots with archived included so an archive is captured as Modified (rollback un-archives). "No memory ever lost" property upgraded to the three-state partition (active|superseded|archived).
> 2. **Founder decision (locked):** soft `archived_at` state in the existing SQLCipher `vault.db`, NOT the BRD's literal separate encrypted-blob store. Same zero-knowledge guarantee, no new crypto path, reversible, ships in one batch. The separate store is a large-scale hot-index-shrink optimization deferred to V1.0+. See ADR-084 D1-D3.
> 3. **FULL DoD GREEN on a fresh cold build:** fmt ✅ · clippy `--all-targets -D warnings` ✅ (20m44s) · build `--workspace` ✅ · `cargo test` ✅ (0 failed across vault-core/-storage/-consolidator/-retrieval/-mcp, incl. the real-BGE `archive_integration` E2E + the three-state property test + migration 0006 test).
> 4. **Disk incident + recovery (logged for prevention).** The FIRST test run filled C: to 0 GB → `link.exe` exit 1201 (disk-exhaustion linker failure, NOT a code bug — clippy+build were already green). Did a full `cargo clean` (reclaimed **180.8 GB**; founder call) → re-ran the whole gate sequence cold → green. **Prevention:** the test-profile build needs ~25 GB headroom ON TOP of the build-profile `target/`; start gate runs with ample free space, and the test-profile link is the disk-peak — see the disk note below.
>

> 1. **Verify CI green** on `12342ed`: `gh run view 27889675293 --json status,conclusion` (or `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1`) should be `success`. A1 is already committed + pushed — just confirm the Linux+Windows matrix went green; if red, read the failing job before any new work.
> 2. **Pick the next arc.** Recommended: a quick **live dogfood of A1 + the ADR-083 contradiction guard together** on a seeded 100/1k vault (closes the carried Findings B + E at a real run, low cost, proves the bloat-control story end-to-end), **THEN start cross-device sync (`vault-sync`, Pillar 3)** — the big remaining V0.2 feature + most security-sensitive (re-read BRD §11 + ADR-SEC before ANY code). Alternatives in §5.

> ### 🧹 Scratch (throwaway) — safe to wipe
> Seeded vaults in `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-*` are all tiny (≤0.25 GB; pristine `seeded-vault-1k` stays). Gate logs `C:\Users\shahb\adr084-{clippy,build,test}.log`. `target/` is a fresh cold build (~no incremental cache yet).
>
> ### 🟡 Tracked, NOT blocking (carried) — Finding E (under-retention) · Finding F (REPORT half-coverage) · Finding B (confirm fixed at next live 100/1k run) · read-precision #1–3 (🟡 insurance) · one-time 1k full backfill (deferred, accept the cost) · separate encrypted archive-blob store (V1.0+, ADR-084 D2) · user-facing MCP "search archive" tool (plumbing ready, small follow-up).

> **🗄️ SUPERSEDED (session 8) — the opener below (verify CI on `e13348e` + build A1) is DONE: CI was confirmed green (run `27859912233` = `success`) and A1 was built this session (above). Kept for the ADR-083 detail.**

> **🆕 2026-06-20 (session 8) — CONTRADICTION OVER-RETENTION GUARD (ADR-083, §8.15) BUILT + DoD GREEN + REAL-Phi-4 VERIFIED + COMMITTED + PUSHED (`e13348e`); CI `in_progress` at session close (run `27859912233`, ~1h matrix — verify green first thing). The "1k cosine-prune" that opened this session was INVESTIGATED + KILLED by measurement (it was the wrong fix); the real work became a correctness fix.**
>
> ### ✅ DONE this session
> 1. **Killed the cosine-prune plan with data.** Two measurement probes (`scale_eval::probe_contradiction_pair_distribution`, real BGE on `seeded-vault-1k`) falsified BOTH speed fixes: the candidate floor is ALREADY 0.70+top-K (not "unpruned"); raising it past ~0.82 drops the real Tesla/Rivian contradiction (0.823); the 1,904 pairs sit at 0.80–0.90 (not low-cosine noise); and the ≥0.92 "near-dups" are **distinct facts** (different person/date/place — `Sam` vs `Aisha` coordinating), so loosening the merge/dedup gate would DESTROY real data. Conclusion: the pair count is a **synthetic-distractor-data artifact**, not a product defect; the nightly incremental run is unaffected; **no safe speed fix exists** → deferred, accepted as a one-time backfill cost.
> 2. **Built the one real correctness fix it surfaced — ADR-083 (§8.15).** The contradiction judge over-retired distinct-but-similar facts (Finding B). Taught Phi-4 the **single-valued-attribute (update→supersede) vs distinct-event (accumulate→keep both)** distinction in the prompt + examples 7/8/9 + an explicit "when in doubt, keep both". **DoD GREEN** (clippy/test/fmt) + **real-Phi-4 verified** (`real_phi4_distinct_events_not_retired`, 3 buckets): clear events (coffee/recap/Paris) all KEPT ✅, clear updates (Berlin→Lisbon, Vega→Atlas) both RETIRED ✅, ambiguous (Denver coordinator, Tesla→Rivian) informational-only.
> 3. **Founder posture locked: "keep when unsure" + demote-not-delete for bloat.** Over-retention is the unrescuable sin; under-retention is agent-rescuable (read picks current truth by `as_of`). Bloat from kept facts is handled by **decay (built) + cold-archive A1 (next) + the reranker**, NOT by risky deletion. See ADR-083.
>
> ### ▶️ FIRST next session
> 1. **Verify CI green** on `e13348e`: `gh run view 27859912233 --json status,conclusion` (or `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1`) should be `success`. The commit (3 files: `contradiction.rs` fix + `real_phi4_distinct_events_not_retired` probe; `scale_eval.rs` `probe_contradiction_pair_distribution` diagnostic; `HANDOFF.md`) is DONE — just confirm the matrix went green; if red, read the failing job before new work.
> 2. **Build A1 cold-archive** — the priority, as the structural anti-bloat tool the "keep when unsure" posture leans on (founder asked the bloat question 2026-06-20). Facts untouched ~`archive_after_days` (365) move OUT of default retrieval to an archive store. First-class `Memory` state change (schema + retrieval-filter) → **policy ADR before code**. See `phases/decay.rs` module doc + §5 item 2.
> 3. **Optional:** re-run the 1k full backfill (timeout off) to close the scale check — now framed as accepting the one-time cost, NOT optimizing it. Wipe `seeded-vault-1k-cosine`/`-live` first.
>
> ### 🧹 Scratch (throwaway) — safe to wipe
> `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-cosine` (the read-only probe copy) · the older `seeded-vault-1k-live`/`-pressure`/`seeded-vault-100*` · logs `C:\Users\shahb\{cosine-probe,cosine-diag,adr083-*}.log`. Pristine seed `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k` UNTOUCHED. Phi-4 GGUF + BGE/reranker fixtures unchanged.
>
> ### 🟡 Tracked, NOT blocking (carried) — Finding E (under-retention, same prompt area, NOT addressed by ADR-083) · Finding F (REPORT half-coverage) · Finding B (now largely fixed by ADR-083, confirm at next live 100/1k run) · read-precision #1–3 (🟡 insurance). The session-7 cosine-prune / loosen-dedup items are RETIRED (falsified — see DONE #1).

> **🗄️ SUPERSEDED (session 7) — the cosine-prune plan below was the OPENING task this session; it was investigated and KILLED (see the session-8 block above). Kept for the 1k evidence + the deferred-items list.**

> **🆕 2026-06-19 (session 7 CLOSE) — incremental consolidation (Steps 1-3) + timeout knob + A/C/D fixes COMMITTED + PUSHED + CI GREEN (`074481c`, run `27823171045` = `success`, 1h0m). Full COLD-build DoD GREEN + LIVE A/C/D re-verify PASSED. Then a 1k full-sweep backfill was started + STOPPED early on purpose (founder call) — it CLEARED the session-5 merge wall and surfaced the next bottleneck. ✅ COMMITTED + CI-VERIFIED.**
> ### ✅ DONE this session
> 1. **Full cold-build DoD pass GREEN** on the whole uncommitted set: `cargo test -p vault-consolidator -p vault-cli -p vault-app` (0 failed, incl. the 4 new A/C/D tests) · `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` (20m28s, 0 warn) · `cargo fmt --all --check`.
> 2. **LIVE A/C/D re-verify PASSED** on a fresh copy (`seeded-vault-100-reverify`): planted 3 fresh contradictions (Thai/Italian, Amsterdam/Berlin, data-scientist/structural-engineer) → incremental run with the fixed binary. **(A)** summary showed `facts retired (contra): 3` + `## Contradictions → Auto-resolved (newer fact won): 3`; **(C)** clustering ran on `active_count=78` (excludes the ~22 already-retired); **(D)** retired facts (Italian/Porto/Japanese) ABSENT from the REPORT, new winners present. Read path: all planted recalls survive, resolved contradictions show only the current value.
> 3. **Committed + pushed `074481c` + CI GREEN** (run `27823171045` = `success`, 1h0m matrix).
> 4. **1k full-sweep backfill — STARTED then STOPPED early (founder call, ~105 min in).** On a copy (`seeded-vault-1k-live`), `VAULT_CONSOLIDATOR_TIMEOUT_SECS=0`. **Result = the session-5 merge wall is CLEARED:** Phase 1 clustering ✅ done; Phase 2 merge ✅ **completed (21 merges across ~92 clusters)** — session-5 died here at 15/102; Phase 2b contradiction ✅ **reached for the first time ever** (`active=911`, `candidate_pairs=1730`). We stopped in Phase 2b rather than grind ~12-15 h to completion, because the headline (wall cleared) + the next bottleneck (below) were already learned.
>
> ### 🔑 THE 1k FINDING → the recommended next work
> **Phase 2b at full-sweep 1k generates ~1,730 contradiction candidate pairs, each judged by a ~20 s Phi-4 call → ~9-10 h for Phase 2b alone (then ~5.5 h enrichment).** That is the real scale bottleneck now (the merge wall is gone). Two things make it tractable:
> 1. **This is a one-time FULL-SWEEP cost only.** The actual incremental feature judges pairs for NEW seeds only (100-fact incremental run = 4 pairs, ~3 min). Nightly runs never pay the 1,730.
> 2. **The deferred "cosine-prune contradiction candidate pairs" fast-follow** (documented in `phases/contradiction.rs` / candidates) is exactly the fix: most of the 1,730 are low-cosine and should be filtered BEFORE the LLM judge. We now have the hard number proving it matters.
>
> ### ▶️ FIRST next session — cosine-prune the Phase-2b candidate pairs, THEN re-run 1k
> 1. **Implement the cosine prune on contradiction candidate pairs** (write the ADR/threshold note first — what cosine floor; gate with a test that a genuine contradicting pair stays above the floor and noise pairs drop, so we don't lose contradiction recall — same recall-safety bar as ADR-082). This makes the 1k full backfill practical (and is on the Pillar-2 path).
> 2. **Then re-run the 1k full backfill** on a fresh copy of `seeded-vault-1k` (the `-live` copy is partial-merged — wipe it). With pruning it should complete in a few hours; confirm it writes the checkpoint + sets the watermark, THEN do the fast incremental run (a few new dup/contradiction facts) → prove incremental-on-1k is minutes + correct against the full corpus.
> 3. **Then** Pillar-2 Step 4 (stored-vector REPORT reuse — also addresses Finding F coverage), catch-up scheduling, full-sweep CLI command, enrich-cap, loosen dedup gate.
>
> ### 🟡 Tracked, NOT blocking (do not lose) — from the A/C/D re-verify + the 1k run
> - **🆕 Finding G — Phase-2b contradiction pairs are unpruned (the 1k bottleneck).** ~1,730 pairs at full-sweep 1k, all LLM-judged. Fix = cosine-prune (see "FIRST next session" above). Full-sweep only; incremental unaffected.
> - **🆕 Finding E — a contradiction didn't resolve at 100 facts.** The career pair (`data scientist` new vs `structural engineer` old) stayed BOTH-active after the re-verify run; `stale_count=3` fired but only 2 of the 3 intended retirements (cuisine, location) showed in the read-path spot-check, so one retirement landed outside the checked set. Same family as Finding B (contradiction judge on repetitive data). Agent still safe (picks newer `as_of`, like the car). Needs a focused enumerate-the-retired-set look. NOT a regression from the A/C/D fix (the judge is untouched).
> - **🆕 Finding F — REPORT topic-coverage is partial.** The post-fix REPORT surfaced **38 of 75 active facts** (30 topics). The A/C/D fix only removes *retired* facts (`valid_until` filter), so this ~half-coverage is pre-existing topic-discovery behavior, not introduced here. The READ PATH is complete (that's the product surface) — but the REPORT artifact under-covering is worth a look. Relates to Pillar-2 Step 4 (stored-vector REPORT reuse).
> - **Finding B** — at 100 facts the contradiction judge retired 24 near-identical "office-noise" distractors; unconfirmed whether genuine dupes or over-aggressive on repetitive data. All planted answers survived. Needs a focused look (enumerate the retired set).
> - **Read-precision (pre-existing 🟡 insurance, gap table):** `memory_read` did NOT abstain on "annual salary" (returned `$6,500 booking` noise) or "cat breed" (returned the golden retriever). Known money-noise + wrong-neighbour traps; agent-rescuable; not regressions.

> **🗄️ SUPERSEDED (session-7 mid) — the gate-then-commit plan below is DONE; kept for the bug detail. 🆕 2026-06-19 (session 7) — incremental consolidation test gate GREEN; feature validated LIVE at 100 facts; 3 correctness-of-artifact bugs FOUND + FIXED.**
>
> ### 📍 Where we are (read this first)
> 1. **The incremental code (Steps 1-3) is test-GREEN.** Re-ran `cargo test -p vault-storage -p vault-consolidator -p vault-app` clean (vault-storage 277 · vault-consolidator 140 · vault-app 58, 0 failed; R1/R2 + properties green). The session-6 linker stall was an env issue; a keep-awake guard prevented a repeat. **The session-6 block below is SUPERSEDED on the test-gate point.**
> 2. **Added a run-time consolidator-timeout knob** (`VAULT_CONSOLIDATOR_TIMEOUT_SECS` in `vault-app/src/application.rs`; `0` = no limit). Default stays 30 min. Needed so a one-time full-sweep backfill on a cold vault can FINISH (enrichment is ~20 s/fact → blows 30 min) instead of being killed mid-job. Not a latency change — just removes the kill-switch for backfill/validation.
> 3. **Validated the feature LIVE at 100 facts** on a throwaway `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-100` (real BGE + Phi-4). The mechanism is PROVEN: full backfill ran to completion (40 min), then an incremental run seeded only the 3 NEW facts (`seed_count=3`, contradiction `candidate_pairs` 117→4, enrichment `enriched=3/skipped=72`), reconciled them against the whole corpus, and finished in **~3 min vs 40**. Read-path dogfood: all current values rank #1 (Italian over Japanese, Berlin over Porto, Rivian), all 8 answerable recalls rank #1, blood-type + OS correctly abstain. **The agent gets correct, current output.**
>
> ### 🐞 What the 100-fact validation EXPOSED (the issue) — 3 correctness-of-artifact bugs
> All three are about the *consolidation artifacts*, not the read path (the read path stayed correct throughout). Likely pre-existing; surfaced by this validation.
> - **Finding A — retirements were INVISIBLE in the run summary.** A run that retired 24 facts by contradiction printed `contradictions queued: 0` and an EMPTY "## Contradictions" section. The footer says "if this run looks wrong, roll it back" — but you can't roll back what the summary hides. Root: the only contradiction counter was the *review-queue* count (`b.contradictions.len()`); the auto-retired (recency clear-winner) facts were counted nowhere.
> - **Finding C — Phase-1 clustering compared NEW facts against already-RETIRED ones.** `find_candidate_clusters` enumerated seeds + the active set with `list_memories(default)` which drops superseded rows but KEEPS `valid_until`-invalidated (retired) rows. A new fact could cluster/merge against a fact that's already out of the current truth.
> - **Finding D — the REPORT included RETIRED facts.** `generate_reports` had the same bug: it listed every non-superseded row (incl. retired), so the on-disk REPORT showed ~100 facts when only ~75 were truly active. (Doesn't reach the user — the read path filters correctly — but the REPORT artifact was wrong.)
>
> ### 🔧 What was FIXED this session (in the working tree, UNCOMMITTED, NOT yet gated)
> - **Finding C** — `vault-consolidator/src/phases/cluster.rs`: seeds + active-set now `.filter(|m| m.valid_until.is_none())` (+ `Memory` import). A retired fact can no longer be a clustering seed or node.
> - **Finding D** — `vault-consolidator/src/consolidator.rs` `generate_reports`: same `valid_until` filter so the REPORT lists only live facts.
> - **Finding A** — counted facts auto-retired by contradiction (BOTH the merge-classifier `clear_winner` path AND the Phase-2b NN path) into a new `BoundarySummary.contradictions_auto_resolved`, surfaced as a new `ConsolidationReport.contradictions_auto_resolved` field, and rendered it in: the CLI summary (`facts retired (contra): N`), the summary-markdown "## Contradictions" section (`**Auto-resolved (newer fact won):** N` + per-boundary detail), and the app completion log.
> - **Tests added:** Finding C → `tests/incremental_consolidation.rs::invalidated_fact_is_excluded_from_clustering`; Finding D → `tests/report_generation.rs::generate_reports_excludes_invalidated_facts`; Finding A → `summary.rs::contradictions_section_surfaces_auto_resolved_retirements` + `_reports_zero_auto_resolved_for_empty_run`. `cargo fmt --all` already run (green).
>
> ### ⚠️ FIRST next session — COLD REBUILD + TEST (the fix is already clippy+fmt green), then re-verify, then commit
> **Context:** this session `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` + `fmt --all --check` BOTH passed on the A/C/D fix (so the code compiles + is lint-clean). The ONLY unfinished gate is the `cargo test` RUN — and it failed PURELY on disk (link.exe exit 1318 while linking the huge `integration_smoke` test binary at ~3 GB free), NOT on code. We then did a **full `cargo clean` (removed 204 GB)** to reset a doubled-up `target/`, so disk is now ~196 GB free.
> 1. **Cold rebuild + test** (this is now a COLD build, ~2.5-3h — **keep-awake guard ON first**, see prevention note below): `cargo test -p vault-consolidator -p vault-cli -p vault-app`. This rebuilds from scratch (the clean wiped everything) then runs the suite incl. the new A/C/D tests. After it's green, re-run `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo fmt --all --check` on the rebuilt tree to re-confirm full DoD before commit. **Run ONE thing at a time (no parallel cargo).** Disk is ample now, but a cold `target/` will grow back to ~60-80 GB — fine.
> 2. **Re-verify A/C/D end-to-end** on a FRESH 100-fact vault (the existing `seeded-vault-100` is already consolidated, so re-seed a fresh copy OR add new contradicting facts + run again). Assert: (A) the run summary now shows `facts retired (contra): N` and a non-empty "## Contradictions" section; (D) the REPORT's active fact count == enrichment's `active=N` (no retired facts in the REPORT); (C) clustering log `active_count` excludes retired facts. The scripts are on disk: `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\incremental_write.py` (writes dup/contradiction facts via MCP) + `read_check.py` (read-path dogfood, uses field `fact`). Full-backfill CLI command + model paths are in the session-7 chat.
> 3. **Then commit + push** (founder pre-approved commit+push) the WHOLE uncommitted set (Steps 1-3 + timeout knob + A/C/D fix) → `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` to CI-verify. The session-6 "prepared commit message" below must be EXTENDED to cover the timeout knob + Findings A/C/D.
> 4. **Then the 1k overnight backfill** (founder plan: 100 ✅ → 1k overnight → 10k deferred to Pillar-2 Step 4). Copy `seeded-vault-1k`, run `consolidate run` with `VAULT_CONSOLIDATOR_TIMEOUT_SECS=0` overnight (enrich backfill ≈ 5.5 h), then an incremental run with a few new dup/contradiction facts → confirm fast + correct against the full 1k.
>
> ### 🟡 Tracked, NOT blocking (do not lose)
> - **Finding B** — at 100 facts the contradiction judge retired 24 near-identical "office-noise" distractors; unconfirmed whether genuine dupes or over-aggressive on repetitive data. All planted answers survived, so recall of real answers was intact. Needs a focused look (enumerate the retired set) — separate from the incremental feature.
> - **Read-precision (pre-existing 🟡 insurance, gap table):** `memory_read` did NOT abstain on "annual salary" (returned `$6,500 booking` noise) or "cat breed" (returned the golden retriever). Known money-noise + wrong-neighbour traps; agent-rescuable; not regressions.
>
> ### 🛡️ Prevention — keep-awake guard before any long cargo run
> This machine idle-sleeps + freezes long unattended builds (that caused the session-6 linker stall). Before any long `cargo` run, hold a background keep-awake task and stop it after: `Add-Type -Name Power -Namespace KeepAwake -MemberDefinition '[DllImport("kernel32.dll")] public static extern uint SetThreadExecutionState(uint e);'; [KeepAwake.Power]::SetThreadExecutionState(0x80000001); while($true){ Start-Sleep 60; [KeepAwake.Power]::SetThreadExecutionState(0x80000001) }` (run_in_background; ES_CONTINUOUS|ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED; blocks idle-sleep only, not lid-close).

[SUPERSEDED 2026-06-19: test gate is now GREEN — see the session-7 block above. The "prepared commit message" below still applies but must be extended with the timeout knob + Findings A/C/D.]**
>
> **What shipped (incremental consolidation core — a nightly run is now O(facts changed), not O(vault)):**
> - **vault-storage:** migration `0005` (`consolidation_state` single-row watermark) + `consolidation_state.rs` (`get/set_consolidation_watermark`) + 4 migration/round-trip tests.
> - **vault-consolidator:** `run_consolidation(since: Option<DateTime<Utc>>)` — `cluster.rs` Phase 1 + `consolidator.rs` Phase 2b both incremental with the **cross-corpus fix** (seeds = `since`-filtered; edges/pairs validated against the WHOLE active set, so a NEW fact still merges / contradiction-checks against an OLD one — ADR-082 §D4). New `candidates::contradiction_candidate_neighbours` (per-seed LanceDB search). Headless `schedule()` made incremental. Full-sweep (`since=None`) path **unchanged**.
> - **vault-app:** safety-wrapper reads the watermark, runs incremental, advances it to the run's START time **only on full pipeline success** (a timed-out/crashed run never advances → next run retries the same backlog; no lost work).
> - **Tests (recall is sacrosanct):** **R1** (`tests/incremental_consolidation.rs`, fast keyed-embedder — a new fact clusters with an old one) + **R2** (`tests/contradiction_resolution.rs`, real BGE — an incremental run retires a stale OLD fact when only the NEW fact is a seed) + full-sweep + idle-vault regressions. All 13 existing `run_consolidation` callers updated to `(None)`.
> - **DoD:** fmt ✅ · clippy `--all-targets -D warnings` ✅ (16m44s) · build `--all-targets` ✅ (145m, slow machine) · `cargo test` ⚠️ **NOT yet run-green** (linker leftover — see FIRST below).
>
> ### ⚠️ FIRST next session — FINISH THE TEST GATE, then COMMIT + PUSH (this is the top priority, before any 1k work)
> The code is written + clippy/build GREEN; only the `cargo test` gate is unfinished. What happened: an overnight idle-sleep froze the test build on a hung `link.exe`; I force-killed it, and the next `cargo test` failed at **link** (`link.exe` exit 1201/1318) on `vault-storage`/`vault-app` test targets — a leftover from the kill, **NOT our code** (clippy + build `--all-targets` already linked those exact targets green). Recovery:
> 1. `cargo test -p vault-storage -p vault-consolidator -p vault-app` — a clean re-run often clears killed-linker file locks (object files are intact; only the final link was interrupted).
> 2. **If the linker errors persist:** surgical `cargo clean -p vault-storage -p vault-app` then re-test (per [[feedback_surgical_cargo_clean_first]] — NOT a full clean; that forces another ~145m cold build).
> 3. Once tests are GREEN: final `cargo fmt --all --check` → `git status --short` → `git add -A` → **commit + push** (founder pre-approved "commit and push" on 2026-06-18) → then `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` to CI-verify.
>
> **🛡️ Prevention (this machine idle-sleeps + freezes long unattended builds):** before kicking off any long `cargo` run, set a keep-awake guard, then clear it after — `Add-Type … SetThreadExecutionState(0x80000001)` (ES_CONTINUOUS|ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED) held in a background task; stop the task when the gate finishes. (Blocks idle-sleep only; closing the lid still sleeps.) NOTE: fmt + clippy + build are already cached GREEN — do NOT `cargo clean` the whole workspace (that forces a fresh ~145m cold build); only the `cargo test` gate remains and it resumes from the warm cache.

> ### ▶️ AFTER the commit lands + CI green — LIVE 1k confirmation (founder ask 2026-06-18)
> **Founder reframe (act on this):** confirm the core feature WORKS + is fully wired at 1k FIRST; latency/timeout comes later.
>
> **STEP 0 — verify green.** `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1` → confirm this push's CI = `success` (ignore any `schedule`-trigger `real-model-smoke` flake — tech-debt #6). Then re-run `cargo test -p vault-storage -p vault-consolidator -p vault-app` locally (warm, fast) to re-confirm Steps 1-3 green before new work.
>
> **🔑 KEY INSIGHT — the 30-min timeout only bites a FULL SWEEP (the cold-start first run), NOT the incremental feature.** An incremental run touches only new facts → fast → never times out. BUT a cold 1k vault's FIRST run pays a one-time **enrichment backfill** (~20s/fact × 1k ≈ 5.5 h — `enrich_facts` is idempotent-by-fingerprint but is NOT `since`-gated, so it re-embeds every un-enriched fact once). That backfill is slow-but-correct, not broken. This is why the live test is two stages.
>
> **STEP 1 — make the consolidator timeout configurable** (small; needed anyway for the deferred full-sweep/backfill mode). `CONSOLIDATOR_HARD_TIMEOUT` in `vault-app/src/application.rs` → env-overridable (e.g. `VAULT_CONSOLIDATOR_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 1800). One edit + warm rebuild + gate.
>
> **STEP 2 — the 1k live acceptance** (on a COPY of `seeded-vault-1k` — never the evidence vault):
>   - **(a) one-time full backfill:** `consolidate run` with a large timeout → let it complete (hours, dominated by enrich) → confirms the pipeline COMPLETES + writes correct REPORTs/checkpoint at 1k AND sets the watermark. **Optionally do ~100 facts first (~40-min full backfill) for a fast green light before the 1k overnight.**
>   - **(b) incremental run:** add a few NEW facts that DUPLICATE / CONTRADICT existing 1k facts (via MCP `memory_write`), then `consolidate run` again → now incremental (enrich skips the 1k; only new facts processed) → **fast** → confirm it correctly merges/retires the new facts against the full 1k corpus (verify via `checkpoint list`, `divergence-check`, REPORT). THIS proves the fix + full CLI/app wiring at scale.
>
> **STEP 3 — then the deferred Pillar 2 follow-ups** (full scope in session-6 chat + the scale scorecard below): **Step 4** stored-vector reuse for REPORT topic-discovery (removes the last embed-all → extends the win to 10k) · **catch-up scheduling** (run on startup if the watermark is stale — the "asleep at 3 AM" fix) · **full-sweep CLI command** · **enrich-cap** (chunk the first backfill across nights) · **loosen the dedup gate** (0/102 dense clusters caught).
>
> **🧹 Scratch:** wipe `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-pressure` (old partial run). Copy `seeded-vault-1k` for the live test; don't mutate the evidence vault. Phi-4 GGUF: `…\com.shahbaz242630.memory-vault\models\Phi-4-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`; BGE + reranker ONNX in `crates/vault-embedding/test-fixtures/`.

> **📊 Session-5 scale scorecard (the WHY for this work) — kept below as evidence:**

> **🆕 2026-06-17 (session 5) — SCALE PRESSURE-TEST DONE (1k, real run). The "still-owed" scale validation is now closed with a definitive result. CI for A2 (`2bc5ba5`, run `27614962589`) = `success`.**
>
> ### 📊 Scale scorecard — 1k full `consolidate run`, 1800s hard budget (MEASURED, not projected)
> Ran the real CLI pipeline against a throwaway copy of `seeded-vault-1k` (`C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-pressure`), real Phi-4 + BGE, full INFO logging. Terminal line: `error: consolidation run failed: consolidator timeout: hard budget exceeded after 1800s`.
>
> | Phase | Result at 1k |
> |---|---|
> | Phase 1 — re-embed 1000 facts + cluster | ✅ **~14 min** · found **102 clusters** (≥0.92) |
> | Phase 2 — merge (LLM) | ⏳ **15 of 102 clusters** done (~52s each) then **TIMED OUT** |
> | Deterministic dedup | **0 fired** — all 102 dense-template clusters went to the LLM merge path (the near-identical two-axis gate was too strict to catch them) |
> | Phase 2b — contradiction | ❌ **never reached** (so `candidate_pairs` is unmeasurable at 1k — itself the finding) |
> | Phase 4 — decay | ❌ never reached |
> | Enrichment (ADR-074) | ❌ never reached |
> | REPORT + checkpoint | ❌ never reached → **partial merged state, NOT rollback-able** (checkpoint is captured only at the END of `run_consolidation`) |
>
> **Per-fact embedding cost measured: ~0.8s/fact via BGE on Intel-UHD/Vulkan** → re-embedding 1k facts ≈ 14 min, 10k ≈ 2.3 h (would blow the budget before a single merge — so 10k was deliberately NOT run; it only confirms-worse at hours of machine load for zero new insight).
>
> ### 🔴 What this means for the product (the real takeaway)
> The auto-scheduler we shipped (T0.2.6) fires THIS pipeline nightly at 03:00. On any real vault past ~100 facts it **times out every night**, never completing a cycle → **never regenerates the REPORT, never writes a checkpoint, never decays/enriches/de-dupes**. Reads still return facts (the REPORT_MISSING fallback is "degraded but harmless"), but the vault **never actually self-maintains at realistic scale**. The "self-maintaining vault" is real at toy scale only. This is the empirical confirmation of the handoff's long-standing Pillar-2 risk.
>
> ### 🧭 ROOT CAUSE = full-vault re-processing every run (architectural, fixable)
> `find_candidate_clusters(..., since: None)` — the `since: Option<DateTime<Utc>>` incremental hook is passed `None`, so EVERY run re-embeds + re-clusters + re-merges + re-enriches the ENTIRE vault. Nightly cost is O(vault size), not O(nightly changes). That is the lever.
>
> ### ▶️ NEXT ARC — Pillar 2: "make the nightly run complete THEN it's already scheduled" (incremental consolidation)
> Recommended order (each step is measurable on its own; write the incremental-semantics ADR before code):
> 1. **Stop re-embedding facts that already have vectors.** Phase 1 (and Phase 2b, and dedup, and enrich) all re-embed via BGE even though the vectors already live in LanceDB. Pull the stored vector instead of recomputing. Phase 1 ~14 min → seconds. **Biggest, cheapest single win.** (Caveat: an ENRICHED fact's stored vector is `content + aliases` — that is the vector we want for clustering anyway, so this is consistent.)
> 2. **Wire the `since` parameter → incremental consolidation.** A nightly run should process only facts written/changed since the last SUCCESSFUL run (the checkpoint table already records runs + timestamps — reuse it). **⚠️ Correctness subtlety to lock in the ADR:** "incremental" must mean *changed facts are the SEEDS, but their candidate partners (merge clusters, NN contradiction pairs) are drawn from the WHOLE active corpus* — otherwise a new fact that contradicts/duplicates an OLD untouched fact would be missed. So: changed-facts drive WHICH comparisons run, not WHICH facts are eligible to be compared against. Get this wrong and we silently lose merge/contradiction recall — gate it with a test that plants a new fact contradicting an old one and asserts detection.
> 3. **Loosen the deterministic dedup gate** so obvious template-near-dups collapse without an LLM call (0/102 caught here is the signal it is mis-calibrated for real repetitive data).
> 4. **Cosine-prune the contradiction candidate pairs** (already a documented fast-follow in `phases/contradiction.rs`).
>
> After 1+2 a 1k nightly run touches only the handful of new facts and finishes in seconds — which is how it must work for the auto-scheduler to be real. Latency budget stays IGNORED for the merge/enrich per-call cost (founder lock 2026-06-14) — the win is doing O(changes) work, not making each call faster.
>
> ### 🧹 Scratch (NOT in repo, throwaway)
> - `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-pressure` — partial-merged 1k copy from this run (15 merges, no checkpoint); safe to wipe.
> - `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\pressure-logs\1k-run.{err,out}.log` — full run logs (the scorecard evidence). Phi-4 GGUF lives at `…\com.shahbaz242630.memory-vault\models\Phi-4-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`.
>
> ### ⬇️ Still-open items carried forward (unchanged by this session)
> A1 cold-archive (small UNBUILT code, write a policy ADR first) · C cross-device sync (`vault-sync`, biggest/most security-sensitive — re-read BRD §11 + ADR-SEC) · beta packaging · B5 auto date-extraction (LOW) · tech-debt §8. **A1 + scale are now decoupled: scale's answer is Pillar 2, above; A1 is independent.**

> **🆕 2026-06-16 — A2 CHECKPOINT & ROLLBACK SHIPPED (`2bc5ba5`, pushed). All 5 DoD gates GREEN on a fresh `cargo clean` cold build).** The "undo a bad nightly run" safety net. Built in one batched pass (no per-step CI cycles — founder directive, the 3h cold build is paid once).
>
> **What shipped (the 5 build-plan steps, all done):**
> 1. **vault-storage `checkpoint.rs`** — `create_checkpoint(entries) -> CheckpointId` (insert + prune to N=7), `rollback_checkpoint(id) -> RollbackReport` (restore 'modified' via existing `update_memory`; `delete_memory` for 'created'; mark `status='rolled_back'`; double-rollback + unknown-id guards), `list_checkpoints()`. Pre-image = versioned `{Memory, embedding}` blob (`CHECKPOINT_PAYLOAD_FORMAT_VERSION`). 8 unit tests. Migration v4 (`0004_…sql`) registered + table-existence test.
> 2. **vault-consolidator `checkpoint.rs`** — capture is a **before/after diff** of the memory set around `run_consolidation` (ALL run-mutations — merge-supersede, dedup, contradiction-invalidate, decay — are metadata-only on existing rows, so a diff is complete + exact). Pre-image embedding reconstructed exactly via `enrich::stored_embed_text` (content, or `compose_embed_text(content, aliases)` if enriched). Wired into `run_consolidation` (`capture_checkpoint`); the `"pending-T0.2.5"` footer placeholder is now the real id; `ConsolidationReport.checkpoint_id` added.
> 3. **vault-cli** — top-level `vault-cli checkpoint list` + `checkpoint rollback <id>` (storage-only; no model flags — see ADR-081).
> 4. **Heavy tests** — `rollback_restores_pre_consolidation_state_exactly` + `rollback_reverts_combined_dedup_and_decay` (both every-cycle, real BGE + MockLlm; assert post-rollback state == pre-run state EXACTLY + "no memory ever lost" + double-rollback guard).
> 5. **Gates GREEN on fresh clean build:** build `--all-targets` 0-warn ✅ · clippy `-D warnings` ✅ · `cargo test -p vault-storage -p vault-consolidator -p vault-cli` all pass (0 failed) ✅ · fmt ✅. Cold build 111m; clippy 22s; tests ~1m. Disk reclaimed by the clean.
>
> **🆕 ADR-081 (A2 design — full text §8.13):** (a) **capture-by-diff**, not per-mutation hooks — robust + zero changes to mutation sites; (b) **enrichment EXCLUDED from rollback** — additive + content-preserving (only adds recall aliases + re-embeds; undoing it just removes a boost the next run re-adds), so it is NOT destructive and need not be reverted; the destructive ops (merge/dedup/contradiction/decay) ARE all captured; (c) **CLI is a top-level `checkpoint` command** (not under `consolidate`) so undo/list need no `--bge-*`/`--phi4-model` flags — mirrors `dead-letter`/`divergence-check`. Founder-locked carryover: capture only-changed pre-images, DEFER graph rollback (tech-debt #2 tripwire), retention N=7.
>
> **▶️ NEXT — once committed + CI-green-verified:** the **scale pressure-test** (STILL OWED — consolidator proven correct at 6 facts only; seed 100 / 1k / 10k, re-run scheduler→pipeline→REPORT→checkpoint→shutdown at each, capture per-scale timing + correctness; KNOWN hardware wall ~90 facts on this machine) **+ A1 cold-archive** (the other half of Phase 4; `memories_archived` returns 0 today). Then beta-on-one-device → **C cross-device sync** (biggest/most security-sensitive; re-read BRD §11 + ADR-SEC first). **B5** (auto date-extraction) LOW-pri. **A3** (invalidate-on-contradiction) LARGELY DONE.
>
> **🧹 Scratch (NOT in repo, throwaway):** `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\scheduler_live_test.py` (scheduler E2E harness) + `client.py` (`fullcheck`/`isolation_test` modes added this session) · seeded throwaway vault `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-sched` (6 facts, consolidated). All safe to wipe.

> ### ⚠️ FIRST next session — VERIFY CI
> `gh run view 27614962589 --json status,conclusion` (the `2bc5ba5` push) should be `success`. It was QUEUED/running at session close (matrix build ~30-60 min). If red, read the failing matrix job log before new work. **Ignore the `schedule`-trigger `real-model-smoke` failures** — that's the known tech-debt #6 concurrent-download flake, NOT our code.
>
> ### 🗺️ Remaining V0.2 work — full map (recommended order)
> The self-maintaining vault is **feature-complete on the core**: merge/dedup · contradiction · decay · REPORT · graph-fill · auto-scheduler (T0.2.6) · checkpoint+rollback (T0.2.5) — all shipped + dogfooded. What's left:
>
> **▶️ RECOMMENDED NEXT — A1 cold-archive + scale pressure-test together** (coupled — archive only matters at large N):
> - **A1 cold-archive** (small UNBUILT code): the other half of Phase 4 — facts untouched for `archive_after_days` (default 365) move to an out-of-default-retrieval store. `memories_archived` returns 0 today (§6 "Not built"). First-class `Memory` state change (schema + retrieval-filter reach, larger than decay) → **write a policy ADR before the code**. See `phases/decay.rs` module doc for the scoping note.
> - **Scale pressure-test (STILL OWED — validation, not new code):** consolidator proven *correct at 6 facts ONLY*. Seed 100 / 1k / 10k (reuse `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k` + `seeded-vault-10k`, still on disk; or `vault-app/tests/scale_eval.rs seed_live_vault`), re-run scheduler→pipeline→REPORT→checkpoint→shutdown at each scale; capture per-scale timing + correctness scorecard. Also test larger/longer content per memory. **KNOWN HARDWARE WALL:** full `consolidate run` does NOT finish in the 30-min budget past ~90 facts (Phi-4 contradiction ~20s/call) → likely needs latency/perf work first, or a documented partial result. (See the session-3 ⚠️ block below.)
>
> **THEN the locked fork (dogfood-first, founder 2026-06-12):** beta-on-one-device dogfood → **C cross-device sync** (`vault-sync`, Pillar 3 — the big UNBUILT feature: zero-knowledge multi-device, server cryptographically cannot read it. Largest + most security-sensitive surface — **RE-READ BRD §11 + ADR-SEC before ANY code**; sync ship-gate ADR-076 already landed).
>
> **Lower-priority / optional:**
> - **Beta packaging + onboarding** (Pillar 4 — `vault-tauri` desktop polish + onboarding flow; V0.2 finish line, BRD §6.2 "30 beta users").
> - **Read-precision hardening (🟡 INSURANCE, not must-fix):** confident-wrong-neighbour cases (salary-$ / wrong-subject) — agent rescues them today (§13.3); build ONLY if a correct fact gets truncated out of view at scale, or to harden Managed-mode. Relates tech-debt #1.
> - **B5 auto date-extraction** (LOW — agent handles temporal today; settable `as_of` works).
> - **Tech-debt cleanup** (§8, none blocking): graph relationship-rewrite-on-merge (#2 tail) · `graph.duckdb` encryption (#7, graph empty) · `VaultError::Storage` → structured variants (#3) · flaky weekly `real-model-smoke` cron (#6, CI-infra).
>
> **🚫 NOT V0.2 (V1.0+):** Gmail/Calendar connectors (`vault-connectors`), billing, Managed multi-tenancy, public launch.
>
> ### 💾 DISK (2026-06-16)
> C: **~10 GB free (tight)**; `target/` = 147 GB (`deps` 105 + `build` 20 = compiled output, can't shrink without a full clean). Freed the 6.25 GB `incremental/` cache this session (SAFE — pure recompile accelerator; build artifacts intact, **no cold rebuild needed**). One-off experiment vaults wiped; `-1k`/`-10k`/`-tiny`/`-sched` kept as test assets. **Only big reclaim left = `cargo clean`** (frees ~147 GB but forces the ~2h cold rebuild) — founder's call if more headroom is needed.

> **🗒️ Session-3 detail — what the feature TEST proved (2026-06-15):**
>
> **What was proven (2026-06-15):** the auto-scheduler fires end-to-end. Added a settable fire-time so it's testable without waiting for 03:00: NEW `--run-at HH:MM` flag on `vault-cli mcp` → threaded through `Application::start_with_mcp(boundaries, consolidation_run_at: Option<NaiveTime>)` (overrides the `ConsolidatorConfig` 03:00 default; logs `overridden=true`). Only the `start_with_mcp` call site was touched (1 prod, 0 real test callers) — NO `AppConfig` change (avoided 16-site churn). vault-cli rebuilt 0-warn; `--run-at` flag live. **Live test** (`C:\Projects\mcp-probe\scheduler_live_test.py`, throwaway `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-sched`, 6 SEED_TINY facts): launched `mcp serve --phi4-model … --run-at <now+4min>`, held the MCP connection open → scheduler fired at the window → full pipeline (merge/contradiction/decay/enrich/REPORT) → `reports\personal.report.json` written → clean shutdown (exit 0, retry worker drained). **REPORT quality correct:** the two near-dup run-facts MERGED to one canonical memory (6→5 facts; new id + `source_agent: null` = real merge); Tesla(2023)/Rivian(2026) CO-LOCATED under one topic `electric_vehicle_driving` (ambiguous-by-design, agent decides — NOT auto-resolved); 4 clean topics. **Gotcha for next tester:** the CLI default tracing filter `warn,vault_cli=info,vault_mcp=info` HIDES the scheduler's INFO logs (target `vault_app::consolidator`) — set `RUST_LOG=warn,vault_cli=info,vault_mcp=info,vault_app=info,vault_consolidator=info` to SEE `scheduler started → scheduled → fired → complete`. Proof this session was the on-disk artifacts (REPORT + timed re-embeds), not the logs.
>
> **⚠️ STILL OWED — SCALE PRESSURE-TEST (Shahbaz, 2026-06-15):** the consolidator/scheduler is proven **WIRED + correct at 6 facts only** — NOT stress-tested. Before declaring done: **seed 100, 1,000, and (if the hardware allows) 10,000 memories, and re-run the FULL suite end-to-end** (scheduler fire → full pipeline → REPORT → shutdown) at each scale. Also pressure-test **larger/longer content (character counts)** per memory, not just short facts. KNOWN HARDWARE WALL (carried from prior sessions): full `consolidate run` does NOT complete within the 30-min budget at ≥~90 facts on this machine (contradiction phase ~20s/Phi-4 call on Intel UHD Vulkan) — so the 1k/10k pressure-test will likely need the latency/perf work (Pillar 2 "make the nightly run complete THEN schedule") before it passes, OR a documented partial-run result. Seed via `scale_eval.rs seed_live_vault` (1k≈17min, 10k=multi-hour/overnight) or extend `scheduler_live_test.py`. Capture per-scale timing + correctness scorecard.

> **🆕 SESSION 2026-06-14 (session 2) — WORKER BUILT (T0.2.6, ADR-080) + all 5 DoD gates GREEN locally (fresh cold build). UNCOMMITTED. Next session = TEST end-to-end + dogfood before commit.**
>
> **What got built — the self-maintaining vault (T0.2.6 scheduling, ADR-080 §8.12).** The consolidator now runs on its own:
> - NEW `crates/vault-consolidator/src/scheduler.rs` — pure, side-effect-free timing helpers (`next_run_after`, `duration_until_next_run`); 7 unit tests cover today-vs-tomorrow / exact-match / month+year rollover. The BRD §5.6 line-1033 `scheduler.rs` slot.
> - `consolidator.rs` — `Consolidator::schedule()` is implemented (was `todo!()`): headless loop (sleep→`run_consolidation`→`enrich_facts`, log-and-continue on failure) + a `run_at()` accessor.
> - `vault-app/src/application.rs` — the **production** scheduler: extracted `run_consolidation_under_safety(consolidator, vault_root)` (the safety-wrapper core), a shutdown-aware `run_consolidator_schedule` loop (mirrors the proven RetryWorker `select!` pattern), wired into `start_with_mcp` (spawns only when a consolidator is configured) + added to `ApplicationHandle` + aborted in `shutdown()`.
> - **Design lock (ADR-080):** the production trigger is **app-layer**, NOT `Consolidator::schedule()`, because the full correct pipeline needs the app-only lockfile + 30-min timeout + enrichment + REPORT-to-disk; the consolidator is filesystem-agnostic by lock and can't call upward. `schedule()` is the headless library equivalent.
> - **Latency budget IGNORED per Shahbaz (2026-06-14):** correctness-of-wiring first, optimisation later. Do not chase the 30-min budget yet.

> **Already on `main` (pushed, CI RED):** `669b8a5` = the ADR-079 `_SECURE_SCL` shim (§8.11). It fixed DuckDB's fmt break but leaked a feature macro into ggml → a 2nd VS2026 break. **Dead end — to be reverted as part of the CI fix (STEP 4 below).**
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔚 NEXT SESSION OPENER — TEST THE WHOLE THING (then commit, then CI)
>
> Goal: prove the end-to-end pipeline + every feature works and returns **correct output every time** (founder thesis). Order: **(1) automated tests → (2) live dogfood via real agents → (3) commit+push → (4) then fix CI.**
>
> **STEP 0 — orient.** Working tree has the uncommitted worker (above), gates already green locally. `main` CI is red (the shim) — IGNORE for now; we test locally + via dogfood first, commit, THEN fix CI.
>
> **STEP 1 — automated end-to-end tests (cargo).** Confirm gates still green, then exercise the live pipeline on a real seeded vault:
> - `cargo test --workspace` — full suite incl. the new `vault_consolidator::scheduler` timing tests (warm cache now — fast).
> - **Live consolidation run end-to-end:** build `vault-cli`, point it at a seeded vault, trigger a real consolidation (CLI `consolidate run`, or set `run_at` near-now to watch the auto-scheduler fire) and confirm it executes the FULL pipeline + writes artifacts. The auto-scheduler firing is the one piece with no unit test (a 24 h wait isn't testable) — verify it live here.
> - **Optional scale probes:** the `#[ignore]` `scale_eval` probes (`probe_real_enrichment_1k`, etc.) if scale re-confirmation is wanted.
>
> **STEP 2 — the FEATURE checklist (verify each end-to-end; ⭐ = new/under-tested this arc).** These are the test features to run + confirm:
> 1. ⭐ **Auto-scheduler (T0.2.6)** — consolidator fires on schedule, runs the full pipeline, shuts down cleanly (no zombie task on Ctrl-C).
> 2. **CRUD** — write → read → update (content replaced) → delete (gone).
> 3. **`memory_read`** — correct structured facts; recall-safe (never false-empty); abstains correctly on genuine absence (cat→no cat, absent OS); `top_relevance` populated.
> 4. **`memory_search`** — reorder-only, recall-safe, `weak_match` hint honest.
> 5. **Boundary isolation + access control** — authorized write accepted; unauthorized → `access denied`; cross-boundary invisible.
> 6. **Encryption at rest** — `vault.db` is SQLCipher (random header, not `SQLite format 3`).
> 7. **Merge / dedup** — near-dup facts collapse, originals superseded.
> 8. **Contradiction detection** — NN-pair + Phi-4 judge surfaces conflicts (note: car/Tesla-Rivian stays ambiguous by design — agent decides).
> 9. ⭐ **Decay (Phase 4, ADR-075)** — stale facts' confidence fades, nothing deleted.
> 10. **Enrichment (Gap-2, ADR-074)** — alias-enriched embed text lifts recall (Porto-in-keyword-soup → rank 1).
> 11. **REPORT generation (ADR-053)** — per-boundary structured knowledge state written to disk.
> 12. ⭐ **Graph-filling (ADR-078)** — entities + relationships extracted at consolidation, traversable, idempotent on re-run (no duplicate edges).
> 13. **Cross-agent read** — Claude / Cursor / Antigravity all read the vault correctly.
>
> **STEP 3 — DOGFOOD via real LLMs/agents (the real acceptance).** This is the main event of next session. Repoint a real client (Antigravity Gemini Flash + Pro, and/or Claude Desktop) at a seeded vault (`mcp-probe/client.py` has `GRADE_QUERIES` + the seed/repoint commands; §13.1 has the Wave-3 method). Then:
> - Let the **auto-consolidator** run (or trigger it), THEN query — confirm the agent composes a CORRECT answer from the structured output on the planted traps (live/kids/allergy/salary/instrument/car), on BOTH a weak and a strong model.
> - Confirm enrichment lift + correct abstains + recall-safety hold live.
> - The bar: **correct output every time the agent asks.**
>
> **STEP 4 — once STEP 1–3 all pass:** commit + push the worker + this HANDOFF (per the confirm-before-commit rule). **THEN fix CI** (its own push): revert the `669b8a5` shim (delete `.github/msvc_fmt_secure_scl_shim.h` + the two ci.yml steps + the `CXXFLAGS_*` env), and **pin the Windows build to the older MSVC 14.4x toolset** (the VS2026 image ships v143 "for compatibility"; use e.g. `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1` with `toolset: 14.4x`, or point the matrix at it) — that fixes BOTH the DuckDB fmt AND the ggml break at once with no force-include leakage. Validate on the cloud robot (CI-only; can't repro on the local older-MSVC machine). Full diagnosis: ADR-079 §8.11.
>
> ### 🧹 Scratch to clean (NOT in repo)
> - `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\client.py` — MCP probe + dogfood harness (modes: grade / crud_test / auth_test / search_test / isolation_test / seed_* — reuse for STEP 1–3).
> - Seeded throwaway vaults under `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-*` (all dogfood test data, safe to wipe).

**Goal:** prove correctness is scale-invariant on a REAL vault that Antigravity opens, at 1k then 10k facts. We already proved it on the internal `scale_eval` harness (100/1k/10k identical scorecard) and live in Antigravity at 100 facts. This is the live confirmation at scale + the close of the arc.

### 🔚 NEXT SESSION OPENER (2026-06-12 close) — **RUN GATES + COMMIT the staged gap-#7 steer (bundle with more code); then Pillar 2 path** — READ THIS FIRST

**▶️ PRIMARY ACTION next session: run the DoD gates + commit the UNCOMMITTED gap-#7 agent-steer code** (3 MCP tool-description edits in `crates/vault-mcp/src/server.rs`, staged this session, NOT yet built/gated — Shahbaz deferred gates to "tomorrow with more code" to avoid a CI cycle on a tiny change). The edits: `memory_read` gains a **decompose-multi-intent + natural-phrasing** steer AND a **single-valued-conflict** steer (the car — prefer newer `as_of`/explicit replacement signal, "say which is current", "don't assume conflict when both can be true"); `memory_search` gains the **one-topic-per-call** steer (it already had natural-phrasing). These encode today's findings ([[project_reranker_brittle_on_terse_queries]] + the car decision). Reach every agent via `tools/list`. **Gate (workspace build 0-warn → clippy → fmt → `vault-mcp` tests) then commit + CI-green-verify.** Bundle with whatever the next code task is.

**THEN — the sequencing Shahbaz + I agreed (2026-06-12):** **(1)** the gap-#7 steer above (knocks out #7 + the car steer #4). **(2) Pillar 2 — auto-run consolidator** (scheduling + decay/archive #6 + checkpoint) — BUT it has a hardware wall: the full nightly run does NOT finish at ~90 facts on this machine (contradiction phase ~20s/Phi-4 call blows the 30-min budget), so Pillar 2 = *"make the nightly run complete (latency/perf) THEN schedule it"*, not just schedule. **(3) real single-device dogfood** of the self-maintaining vault. **(4) Pillar 3 — cross-device sync** (biggest/most security-sensitive; fold gap #5 graph-crypto into its security review). Lean: dogfood-first before sync.

**Wave 3 is COMPLETE — full results + vault-level replay in §13.1; Arc B (car/temporal) spiked + reverted in §13.2.** Both Flash (weak) and Opus 4.6 (strong) landed correct answers on essentially every trap. **KEY REFRAME (2026-06-12, Shahbaz):** since the agent produces CORRECT OUTPUT across every tested trap (incl. salary/allergy/wrong-neighbour), gaps **#1/#2 (read precision) are NOT confirmed-broken — they are agent-handled today**, same logic that closed the car. They drop from "must-fix" to **🟡 insurance** (build only if a correct fact gets truncated out of the agent's view at scale, or to harden Managed-mode where unknown weak agents connect). **No confirmed-broken output exists in the gap table.** Updated gap classification: §13.3 (NEW). **The PRIMARY ACTION further below (re-run Wave 3) is SUPERSEDED — Wave 3 is done.** Original Wave-3 instructions kept below for reference.

**What's done (2026-06-11).** (1) CI **green** on `d613614` (Gap-2, run `27277023260`). (2) Gap-2 **live-confirmed through the real MCP read path at 1k** — fresh `seeded-vault-1k` copy, bare vs enriched A/B both via `memory_read`/`memory_search`: buried Porto **ABSENT → rank 1** in search + present in read facts; twins/hives weren't buried. Nuance: hardest keyword-soup query enriched read still `abstain=True` (reranker scores the wording-mismatch low — enrichment fixes recall-into-pool, NOT the reranker score; never-empty returns the fact anyway → recall-safe). (3) **Full-aspect live test campaign on a NEW messy+clean dogfood vault** (`seeded-vault-mixed`, ~94 facts) via a scripted MCP stdio client — Antigravity quota hit (~10h reset) so I drove the MCP server directly. **Scorecard + failure root-causes in §13 (NEW).** No code change this session; CI stays green on `d613614`.

**▶️ PRIMARY ACTION — Wave 3: live-agent test in Antigravity once quota resets.** Config ALREADY repointed to `seeded-vault-mixed`. Restart Antigravity, confirm via `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='vault-cli.exe'" | Select CommandLine`, then run the 10 planted-trap questions (verbatim in `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\client.py` → `GRADE_QUERIES`; grading key in `SEED_NOTES`) on **BOTH a weak model (Gemini Flash) and a strong model (Gemini Pro)**. The question: does each model compose a CORRECT answer from the structured output — esp. the wrong-neighbor cases where a distractor ranks #1 (live→Lisbon, kids→Marcus, allergy→Marcus's peanut, salary→$450, car→Tesla)? Strong agent expected to recover; weak agent at risk — that delta IS the read-precision evidence.

**Optionally first:** enrich `seeded-vault-mixed` (surgical, like the 1k proof — extend `probe_real_enrichment_1k` to loop `enrich_one` over ALL active facts, no contradiction phase, no 30-min cap; one build) so Wave 3 also exercises the Gap-2 lift on messy data (Porto buried on keyword-soup). **Full `consolidate run` does NOT work on this hardware at ≥~90 facts** — the contradiction phase alone (~20s/Phi-4 call on the Intel UHD Vulkan GPU) blows the 30-min budget before enrichment runs (proven twice: the 100-probe + this session). The **TINY-vault path (≤~6 facts) DOES complete (27.6s)** — that's how merge/REPORT/enrichment were verified this session.

**Then the open arcs.** The retrieval *plumbing* is proven correct on messy data; the work now is the *precision/abstain* layer. **The 6 non-pass items from §13, each → its fix/build + priority (so nothing is lost):**

| # | Gap (§13) | Fix / build | Priority | Tracked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Salary $-trap (answers instead of abstaining on money-shaped noise) | read-precision: add a category/ownership veto + per-candidate filter so a confident wrong-*kind* match is rejected | 🔴 HIGH — but gate on Wave 3 first (see if a strong agent already recovers) | read-precision arc, roadmap §5 item 1; tech-debt #1 |
| 2 | Wrong-neighbor #1 ordering (mother/Marcus/dog out-ranks the user's own fact) | read-precision: a subject/ownership signal so "about the user" beats "about an associate" | 🔴 HIGH — same arc as #1 | roadmap §5.1; relates [[project_reranker_subjectless_facts_framing]] |
| 3 | Blood/OS marginal abstain (squeak over the no-signal floor) | read-precision: tune/curve the no-signal floor or per-candidate gate | 🟠 MED — same arc as #1 | roadmap §5.1 |
| 4 | Contradiction not resolved (Tesla/Rivian both stay active) | temporal: fact-time `as_of` (date extraction or settable) + tune the Phi-4 contradiction judge | 🟠 MED — own arc | §4 carried follow-up; [[project_as_of_write_time_blocks_a5_temporal]] |
| 5 | `graph.duckdb` plaintext | verify ADR-010 DuckDB-encryption status; wire it if truly unshipped | 🟢 LOW (graph empty in V0.2) | tech-debt #7 |
| 6 | Decay / archive not built | BUILD Phase 4 (age-out + archive old memories) | 🟢 planned BUILD (not a bug) | roadmap §5 item 2; §6 "Not built"; T0.2.4 |

**Honest sequencing:** #1–#3 are ONE arc (read precision, roadmap §5.1) and are the highest-value fix — but **run Wave 3 first**, because if the strong agent already composes correct answers despite the wrong-neighbor ordering, that re-prioritises how hard we push #2. #4 is its own (temporal) arc. #5 is low-pri tech-debt. #6 is a scheduled build, not a defect.

### 🧰 Scratch state (NOT in repo — clean up when done)
- **MCP probe client:** `C:\Projects\mcp-probe\client.py` — the scripted MCP stdio test harness built this session (modes: discover / inspect / measure / grade / crud_test / auth_test / search_test / isolation_test / seed_mixed / seed_tiny / car_check / write_killers). Run: `$env:PROBE_VAULT=<vaultdir>; $env:BOUNDARIES='personal,testeval'; python client.py <mode>`.
- **Scratch vaults (all throwaway dogfood):** `seeded-vault-mixed` (~94 messy+clean, Wave-3 target), `seeded-vault-tiny` (6-fact consolidation demo — MERGED + REPORT written), `seeded-vault-1k-probe` (3 killers enriched), `seeded-vault-1k-bare` (3 killers bare), `seeded-vault-100-probe`. Real evidence vaults `seeded-vault-{100,1k,10k}` untouched.
- **Antigravity config** points at `seeded-vault-mixed`. Backups: `mcp_config.json.bak-1k` (was 1k), `mcp_config.json.bak-realvault` (real production vault). **Restore real vault when fully done:** set the 3 paths back to `C:\Users\shahb\AppData\Roaming\com.shahbaz242630.memory-vault\{vault.db,lance,graph.duckdb}`, restart.

**Tech-debt #6** (cheap, ride with the next code commit): `--test-threads=1` on `ci.yml:702` to re-light the weekly smoke. **Tech-debt #7 (NEW):** verify `graph.duckdb` encryption — ADR-010 scoped it for T0.2.0 but the store still opens PLAINTEXT (`DUCK` magic bytes confirmed) and the runtime still WARNs "ships in T0.2.0"; low risk (graph empty in V0.2) but claim/reality diverge.

> **🟢 Plumbing solid on messy data.** Storage / retrieval / security / structural aspects all PASS (§13). Remaining work is the precision/abstain layer + temporal resolution — known, scoped, the 85→100 arc. Founder thesis is *correct output*, so Wave 3 (does a real agent land the right answer from the structured output) is the next acceptance.

### 📌 Reference — seed / verify / repoint commands (1k is DONE + live; reuse these for the 10k re-seed in step 4 above)
1. **Seed** (swap `SEED_N`/`SEED_VAULT_DIR` for 10k): `$env:SEED_N='1000'; $env:SEED_VAULT_DIR='C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k'; cargo test -p vault-app --test scale_eval seed_live_vault -- --ignored --nocapture` — 1k ≈ 17 min; 10k = multi-hour/overnight (drain rate degrades). Waits for full VECTOR-count drain, then prints the test script.
2. **Verify the seed:** `$env:LANCE_MEM_POOL_SIZE='268435456'; & "C:\Projects\GitHub\Memory Vault\target\debug\vault-cli.exe" --vault-db C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k\vault.db --vector-dir C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k\lance --graph-db C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k\graph.duckdb divergence-check` — expect `sqlite == vector`, **no findings**.
3. **Repoint Antigravity:** edit the REAL config `C:\Users\shahb\.gemini\config\mcp_config.json` (the `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` is a SYMLINK to it — edit the real target). Change the 3 vault paths (`--vault-db`/`--vector-dir`/`--graph-db`) to `seeded-vault-1k`. **Restart Antigravity.** Confirm: `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='vault-cli.exe'" | Select CommandLine`.
4. **Run the 15 questions** (`crates/vault-app/tests/fixtures/scale_eval.json`; seeder prints them with expected answers). Watch: #6 cello (subject-less fact), #12 salary + #14 cat-breed (the Thread-2 precision traps), the 5 abstains.
5. **Seed + test 10k** the same way (`SEED_N='10000'`, `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-10k`). **10k seed is MULTI-HOUR** (~1s/vector × 10k, degrading) — plan an overnight run. Verify + repoint + test as above.
6. **If 1k AND 10k both pass live →** (a) commit the seeder (`crates/vault-app/tests/scale_eval.rs` `seed_live_vault` + the vector-count-drain probe) with full DoD gates → CI green; (b) declare the retrieval core "battle-tested at scale," close this arc. Thread 2 (read precision) becomes the next arc.

### ⚙️ Working-tree state
- **Last SHIPPED: `d613614`** (Gap-2 / ADR-074), pushed to `main`; **CI `27277023260` was `in_progress` at session close — verify `success` first thing next session.** Prior green: `a3e426b` (ADR-073, run 27150216167).
- **Uncommitted: HANDOFF.md ONLY** (this session-close opener rewrite + "Last updated") — admin-only, rides with the next code commit per admin-rides-with-code. The working tree is otherwise clean (the fix below is committed in `d613614`).
- **Shipped in `d613614`** (one commit, admin rode with code):
  - **NEW `crates/vault-consolidator/src/phases/enrich.rs`** — `generate_aliases` (Phi-4, JSON `{"aliases":[...]}`, tuned to single-word generic keywords), `compose_embed_text` (`"<content> Topics: <aliases>"`), `content_fingerprint` (FNV-1a), `set_enrichment_metadata`, **`pub enrich_one`** (exposed for the live probe) + 11 mock-LLM unit tests + `real_phi4_alias_quality` `#[ignore]` probe.
  - **`crates/vault-consolidator/src/consolidator.rs`** — `Consolidator::enrich_facts` + `EnrichmentReport` + 2 idempotency tests; `phases/mod.rs` (+`pub mod enrich`); `lib.rs` (export `EnrichmentReport`).
  - **`crates/vault-app/src/application.rs`** — `enrich_facts` wired into `run_consolidation_with_safety` (after consolidation, before `generate_reports`, under the 30-min budget).
  - **`crates/vault-app/tests/scale_eval.rs`** — NEW `probe_real_enrichment_1k` `#[ignore]` (real-Phi-4 end-to-end 1k rank-lift A/B) + the two `map_or(true, …)`→`is_none_or` clippy fixes. The ruler (this + `scale_eval.json` `_phrasing` variants + drain-poll fix + 3 `#[ignore]` probes from 2026-06-09) rides with this commit per commit-only-with-tested-fix.
  - **`HANDOFF.md`** — §8.6 ADR-074 full text + §9 index + this state + opener + "Last updated".
- **Build cache:** full `cargo clean` + cold rebuild done this session (disk had hit 0 GB during the first gate run; clean reclaimed 137 GB). Build was 36m38s; gates ran clean after.
- **Memories updated (outside repo, 2026-06-09):** `project_1k_live_paraphrase_recall_miss` REWRITTEN (Gap-2 re-diagnosis + proven fix) + MEMORY.md index line.
- **Memories updated (outside repo):** `project_1k_live_paraphrase_recall_miss` REWRITTEN (Gap-2 re-diagnosis + proven fix; old framing marked falsified) + MEMORY.md index line.
- **Scratch on disk (not repo):** `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k-probe` (a throwaway copy used by the probes — safe to delete; `Remove-Item` before re-copy since `Copy-Item -Force` MERGES). The real evidence vault `C:\Projects\seeded-vault-1k` is untouched.

### 🔧 Antigravity config — state + revert
- **Backup of the original real-vault config:** `C:\Users\shahb\.gemini\antigravity\mcp_config.json.bak-realvault`.
- **To restore the real vault when done:** set the 3 paths back to `C:\Users\shahb\AppData\Roaming\com.shahbaz242630.memory-vault\{vault.db, lance, graph.duckdb}` in `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, restart Antigravity.

### 🧠 Seeder gotcha (don't regress)
Confirm drain by **VECTOR ROW COUNT** (`LanceVectorStore::count`), NOT by searching for a sentinel fact — search finds a fact via the keyword channel BEFORE its vector lands in LanceDB, which once shipped a **1-of-101-vector vault** (caught only by `divergence-check`). The seeder polls a re-opened `LanceVectorStore` count each tick until `== total`. A freshly-seeded vault shows a cosmetic `REPORT_MISSING` / `status: degraded` health warning (consolidator hasn't run) — harmless, does NOT affect answers; clear later via `vault-cli consolidate run` (needs `--phi4-model`; do it when the MCP server is NOT holding the vault — single-writer).

## 2 · 🧭 Where the build is

V0.2 read/consolidate core is functionally complete and CI-green. The work since T0.2.3 was a long correctness-at-the-output arc (the founder thesis: *"memory is only useful if the output is correct"*). Net result:

- **Read path** returns structured facts, NO LLM at read (`StructuredReadPipeline`, ~500ms). The calling agent composes the answer. Recall-first by lock: never false-empty.
- **`memory_read`** is the primary answer path (returns structured `abstain`); **`memory_search`** is reorder-only + recall-safe (never false-empties) with an additive `weak_match` hint. (ADR-066/069/071)
- **Reranker** (Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B, cross-encoder) is the read relevance authority, lazily loaded off the MCP handshake. (ADR-059/070)
- **Consolidator** produces a per-boundary REPORT (structured knowledge state) nightly; contradiction detection is nearest-neighbor based. (ADR-053/065)
- **Cross-agent proven:** Claude, Cursor, Antigravity all read the vault correctly. Validated at 100 facts live across both tools and both model tiers.
- **Scale:** `scale_eval` harness shows correctness is scale-invariant 100→1k→10k (identical scorecard). The one 10k internal crash (a flaky, data-safe storage-worker race) is fixed + shipped (ADR-072).

**Last shipped commit:** `da10c0f` (ADR-072, 10k TOCTOU fix), CI-green run `27096332980`. Recent chain: `a3c938b`→`661d391`→`a1e4dac`→`da10c0f` all matrix-clean.

**The locked arc** ([[locked-next-arc-t03x]], amended 2026-05-26) — all four steps SHIPPED:
1. ✅ MCP `memory.write` description hardening (`93d1410`)
2. ✅ Consolidator → REPORT (Batch A, `f0cc158`, ADR-053)
3. ✅ Read returns structured facts, no LLM at read (Batch B Commit 6, `99052f2`, ADR-052/054)
4. ✅ Consolidator wired into runtime + manual CLI trigger (`f0cc158`)

Phase C (write-time decision loop) DEFERRED to V1.0+.

---

## 3 · 🔒 Architectural locks (do not relitigate without explicit founder sign-off)

- **LLM is OUT of the read path** (2026-05-26). The read consumer is itself an LLM (the agent); pre-composing prose was redundant. Vault returns structured facts; agent composes. Delivered ~170× local speedup, ~50× BYOK cost cut, ~10× Managed PAYG margin. Phi-4-mini stays at nightly consolidation only. [[project_architectural_lock_llm_out_of_read_path]]
- **Recall is sacrosanct.** A false-abstain (vault has the answer but says "I don't know") is the cardinal sin — far worse than a false-answer. Every read/search change is recall-safe by construction: reorder-only, never false-empty. [[project_memory_read_primary_search_recall_safe]]
- **Correctness of output IS the product.** Storage + retrieval are table stakes; correct output to the agent is the differentiator. Don't burn cycles on prose polish when the structured field is already correct. [[project_correctness_is_the_product]] · [[feedback_structured_contract_user_sees_via_agent]]
- **Correctness before latency** (V0.2). Get core quality to 100% first; don't preempt latency work until the founder signals the core is structurally solid. [[project_correctness_before_latency]]
- **Three-mode deployment** (Local $10 / BYOK $5mo / Managed PAYG) shares one codebase; every architectural decision must be mode-agnostic. Managed = per-user vault + per-user key. [[project_three_mode_deployment]] · [[project_managed_mode_per_user_vault]]
- **Zero-knowledge guarantee:** the server cryptographically cannot read vault contents. No crypto-path change without re-reading BRD §11 + an ADR-SEC entry.
- **Never recommend sub-7B models for read-time synthesis** (Qwen2.5-7B is the quality floor) — moot now that the LLM is out of read, but stands if read-synthesis is ever revisited. [[feedback_no_sub_7b_models_for_synthesis]]

## 4 · 🟠 Open threads (next arcs, NOT blockers for the 1k/10k validation)

### Thread 2 — retrieval vocabulary gap (Gap 1 SHIPPED; Gap 2 IMPLEMENTED — ADR-074, gates green, pending live validation + commit) — own arc, ACTIVE
**Status RE-DIAGNOSED 2026-06-09** (ground-truth probe on the real `seeded-vault-1k`, 3 domains — see §4.2 below; falsifies the 2026-06-08 framing). Gap 1 (read false-abstain) is SHIPPED (ADR-073). **Gap 2 is NOT "BGE can't handle paraphrase/idiom"** — natural idioms work fine ("call home" → Porto rank 1). The real root is a **vocabulary gap**: a fact phrased without the obvious keyword ("settled in **Porto**", "raising **twins**", "comes out in **hives**") gets outranked by — or in a dense-distractor field drops below — facts that carry the literal keyword. **The proven fix is document-side alias enrichment, NOT query expansion** (which backfires — it IS the keyword-soup that triggers the miss). Full evidence + fix validation in §4.2.

#### Gap 1 — read-gate false-ABSTAIN (gate layer; fact IS retrieved, gate drops it)
**The bug (confirmed live, 1k vault).** `memory_read` **false-abstained** — returned `relevant_facts: []`, `abstain: true` — on facts that ARE in the vault:
- *"how do I stay fit"* and *"exercise running cycling"* → both `abstain: true`, even though *"runs ten kilometres three times a week"* AND *"cycles to the office"* are stored (the 2nd query literally contained "running"/"cycling"). The agent only recovered by falling back to `memory_search`. A weaker agent would have told the user "I don't have that" — the exact cardinal sin the recall-safe lock exists to prevent ([[project_memory_read_primary_search_recall_safe]]).

**Root cause (measured).** `memory_read` abstains on an **absolute reranker floor (ADR-059: logit 0 = relevance 0.50)**. But the reranker scores real answers far below that — and is sometimes actively wrong:

| live query | top relevance | #2 | separation | `weak_match` | truth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| "stay fit" | 0.0388 | 0.0061 | ~6× clear winner | false | real answer (runs 10km) — **read abstained** ❌ |
| "morning routine" | 0.5256 (cycles) / 0.18 (flat white) | — | — | false | both real; flat white below 0.5 floor |
| "what does the user eat" | 0.0639 | 0.0473 | ~1.3× murky | true | real answer (*Japanese cuisine* didn't even make search top-10 — ranked below cafeteria-noise) |
| "operating system" (absent) | 0.000065 | 0.000055 | flat | true | genuinely nothing — abstain correct ✅ |
| "cat breed" (absent; dog present) | 0.00028 (dog) | 0.00003 | ~9× | false | no cat — dog is no-signal-level; agent correctly said "no cat, but a dog" ✅ |

Two takeaways: (1) **real answers live at relevance 0.04–0.99; no-signal/wrong-neighbor lives at 0.00006–0.0003** — a ~100× gap. The logit-0 (0.50) floor sits on top of the real answers and mows them down. (2) `memory_search` already gets all these RIGHT (separation-based, never empties); only `memory_read`'s gate is broken. ADR-066 said "reranker is a re-orderer, NOT a precision authority" — yet ADR-059 still uses its absolute score as the abstain gate. That contradiction IS the bug.

**The fix (3 parts, every threshold backed by the live data above).**
1. **Kill the logit-0 abstain floor** in `memory_read` (the whole false-abstain).
2. **Adopt `memory_search`'s separation-based logic** + a *much* lower no-signal floor (~relevance 0.001). Real answers (≥0.04) clear it; C7/C8 (≤0.0003) don't. (Separation alone is insufficient — C8's dog separated 9× yet is no-signal-level — so combine separation with the low absolute floor.)
3. **Never hard-empty `relevant_facts`.** Even when `abstain`-leaning, return the top candidates + a `weak_match`/confidence hint and let the agent judge. Proven live: given the dog fact, the agent correctly abstained on "cat" while surfacing the dog. `abstain` becomes a *hint*, not a fact-shredder.

Net: make `memory_read` behave like `memory_search` already does. The over-inclusion/false-answer side (salary→$, cat→dog, keyboards-leak) is the *same* root (absolute reranker score is an unreliable gate) and the weak-match hint covers it too — the agent judges instead of the vault hard-deciding.

#### §4.2 Gap 2 — RE-DIAGNOSED 2026-06-09 (ground-truth probe, fix proven)
**What it is NOT.** The 2026-06-08 framing ("the idiom 'call home' misses Porto; fix = vault-side query expansion") is **FALSIFIED**. Ground-truth probing of the real `seeded-vault-1k` (new `probe_live_vault` / `probe_family_domain` / `probe_enrichment` tests in `scale_eval.rs`, run live across 3 domains — location, relationships, health) shows the bare idiom finds the fact fine: *"where does the user **call home**"* → Porto **rank 1** (0.4339); *"live"* → rank 1 (0.95); *"is the user married?"* → rank 1.

**What it actually is — a VOCABULARY GAP, two failure modes.** A fact phrased *without* the obvious keyword — "settled in **Porto**" (not "lives in"), "raising **twins**" (not "kids"), "comes out in **hives**" (not "allergy") — is outranked by, or (in a vault with a DENSE field of lexically-overlapping distractors) drops out of the candidate pool below, facts that carry the literal keyword:
1. **Recall miss** under dense matching-domain noise. The ONE outright miss was the agent's **keyword-soup** query `"home location city country lives residence"` → Porto **ABSENT**, top 0.0013, buried under Salt-Lake-City/travel distractors. (That Salt-Lake-City pool is exactly what 2026-06-08 mis-pinned on "call home".) Sparse domains (family/health) don't bury the target, but →
2. **Confidence collapse.** Keyword-soup queries score ~0.008–0.03 (no-signal level) → `memory_read` abstains even when recall holds. And a 3rd-party fact carrying the keyword ("Marcus carries an epipen for his peanut allergy", 0.96) outranks the user's own answer ("comes out in hives", 0.18) for "is the user allergic?".

**So keyword-padding is the TRIGGER, not the cure** — vault-side query expansion would replicate the harmful soup. The fix is **document-side**.

**The fix — PROVEN by A/B probe (`probe_enrichment`).** Enrich each fact's *embedded text* with normalized aliases/topics. Measured on the hardest case: bare Porto **ABSENT** → enriched Porto (`"…Topics: home, lives, residence, city, country, location"`) **rank 1 @ 0.9965** on the exact killer keyword query, with **no regression** on natural ("where does the user live": enriched #1 / bare #2). Twins: bare rank 5 → enriched rank 1 (natural AND keyword). **Where it lives:** the consolidator's Phi-4 pass already touches every fact → generate the alias/topic line there (fits [[project_locked_next_arc_t03x]] consolidator arc; keeps the LLM out of the read path). **Query-side expansion SHELVED; stronger embedder = last resort.** Full detail: [[project_1k_live_paraphrase_recall_miss]].

**Decision LOCKED 2026-06-09: generate aliases with Phi-4 at consolidation (Option B), NOT write-time agent aliases (Option A).** Rationale + recon in §1 opener step 1. Remaining ADR-074 specifics to lock: (a) Phi-4 alias prompt + output format; (b) `metadata` storage key + embed-text composition (`content + aliases`); (c) when it runs / re-embed cost (backfill of existing facts is the point). A deterministic synonym map was rejected — "settled in Porto" → "home/residence" needs comprehension, not a thesaurus.

#### Harness gap — root was DEEPER than "favorable phrasings" (FIXED 2026-06-09)
`scale_eval`'s `scale_correctness_eval` scored **"false-abstain: 0 / recall perfect"** at 1k/10k for TWO reasons: (1) favorable fixture phrasings (added plain/idiom/keyword `_phrasing` variants + a per-phrasing recall scorecard), and — the deeper one — (2) its readiness poll broke at *"Rivian searchable"* (BM25 hits before the vector lands), so the query pass ran against a **half-drained vector store** (`ready after 0s` vs the honest `1546s`) — almost no distractor competition → artificially perfect recall. **Fixed:** the poll now waits for `LanceVectorStore::count == total` (mirrors `seed_live_vault`). NOTE: even fully-drained at 1k the in-process harness can't reproduce the keyword miss without the dense-distractor condition — the faithful repro is the real-vault probe (`PROBE_VAULT_DIR`). The ruler (variants + drain fix + 3 probe tests) is uncommitted; it rides with the Gap-2 fix commit per commit-only-with-tested-fix.

**Verdict:** engine solid + premium experience excellent (Opus: rich answers, graceful abstains on blood-type/salary/OS, never hallucinated the salary-$ or cat→dog traps, offered to save missing facts). But these two recall-robustness gaps gate the "battle-tested" call. **Full evidence:** [[project_1k_live_read_false_abstain]] + [[project_1k_live_paraphrase_recall_miss]] + this session's 1k Antigravity transcript (17 queries). Related tech-debt #1 (carry-cosine-through-fusion + per-candidate filter, §8) is the same surface as Gap 1.

### Carried follow-ups (not blockers)
- **REPORT_MISSING cleanup** — run the consolidator on the live seeded vaults to clear the cosmetic `status: degraded` warning (needs `--phi4-model`, server not holding the vault).
- **`max_results` 10 → 5** — proven safe at top-5; one change at a time.
- **Antigravity `instructions.md` rewrite** — steer agents to prefer `memory_read`; empty result = not in vault.
- **`as_of` is write-time, not fact-time** — content dates aren't parsed; blocks the A5/A4 temporal contradiction cases. Open decision: settable `as_of` vs date-extraction. [[project_as_of_write_time_blocks_a5_temporal]]

## 5 · 🗺️ Post-scale roadmap (V0.2 remaining) — pick the start point

Once the 1k/10k live test passes (§1), the retrieval **core** is proven correct + scale-solid. These four pillars complete V0.2. Founder picks where to start; my recommended order is **1 → 2 → (fork: 3 or 4)**.

**1. Read precision (Thread 2) — close the last known quality gap.** 🟢 *recommended first*
The vault sometimes returns a confident wrong-neighbor instead of abstaining ("salary?" → catering $; "cat?" → the dog; "instrument?" → cello-correct + keyboards leaked). Fix = recall-safe `weak_match` hint on `memory_read` (let the agent judge, never drop a fact). Contained, high-value, squarely the "correctness IS the product" thesis. Full detail in §4 (Thread 2). Related: tech-debt #1 (carry-cosine-through-fusion + per-candidate filter) in §8.

**2. Sleep consolidator — make it COMPLETE on its own at scale.** 🌙 *(updated 2026-06-17 by the scale pressure-test)*
The build-out is DONE: **Scheduling** (T0.2.6) ✅, **Phase 4 decay** (T0.2.4) ✅, **Checkpoint + rollback** (T0.2.5) ✅ — all shipped. The open Pillar-2 work is now **performance, specifically incremental consolidation**: the 1k pressure-test (§1) proved the full nightly run **times out at the 1800s budget on ≥~1k facts** because every run re-processes the WHOLE vault (re-embed all ~14 min/1k → re-cluster → re-merge all). So the auto-scheduler fires nightly but never completes → no REPORT/checkpoint/decay/enrich ever land at realistic scale. **Fix arc (full scope in §1):** (1) stop re-embedding facts that already have stored vectors; (2) wire the `since`-checkpoint param so a run touches only facts changed since the last successful run (changed facts as SEEDS, partners drawn from the whole corpus — ADR + recall test required); (3) loosen the dedup gate; (4) cosine-prune contradiction pairs. The remaining unbuilt piece is A1 **cold archive** (T0.2.4's other half — write a policy ADR first).

**3. Cross-device sync (`vault-sync`) — the big multi-device feature.** 🔄
The V0.2 promise: your memory on every device, readable by any agent, **without the server ever reading it** (zero-knowledge sync). Largest + most security-sensitive surface → re-read BRD §11 first, ADR-SEC entries required. **Ship gate:** tech-debt #4 (`pending_sync` sweep + migration 0003 payload, §8) MUST land before sync beta opens.

**4. Beta packaging + 30 real users.** 🚀
Onboarding flow, desktop-app polish, getting it into hands. The V0.2 finish line (BRD §6.2: 30 beta users).

**The one real fork (a couple weeks out, founder's call):** after 1 + 2, do **sync first** (full multi-device vision before anyone tries it, longer to first users) **or beta-on-one-device first** (real users + feedback sooner; even single-device the vault is genuinely useful; sync follows). Recommendation leans beta-first per the bootstrap reality — get one device perfect + dogfood-proven before taking on the heavy sync surface.

## 6 · 📦 Consolidator inventory — what's built vs not (read FIRST when planning consolidator work)

`vault-consolidator` has ~1,000 LOC production + ~1,200 LOC tests. Do NOT re-discover.

**Built + tested ✅**
| Component | File | Notes |

**Not built ❌**
| Gap | Scoped | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 4 — Decay | T0.2.4 | **Decay BUILT (ADR-075)**; cold archive still deferred — `memories_archived` returns 0 |
| ~~Checkpoint + rollback~~ | T0.2.5 | **BUILT 2026-06-16 (ADR-081, §8.13) — UNCOMMITTED.** Capture-by-diff in `run_consolidation`; `vault-cli checkpoint list`/`rollback <id>`; real `checkpoint_id` in the report + footer. Enrichment excluded; graph rollback deferred (tech-debt #2). |
| ~~Scheduling~~ | T0.2.6 | **BUILT 2026-06-14 (ADR-080, §8.12) — UNCOMMITTED pending test.** `scheduler.rs` pure timing + `Consolidator::schedule()` headless loop + app-layer production scheduler in `start_with_mcp`. Latency deferred. |

## 7 · 🧰 Technique map (locked 2026-05-26) — summary

Mapped against: **A** Write · **B** Read · **C** Consolidate · **D** Sync · **E** Scale · **F** Privacy. Full table in PART2 archive.

- **Keeping:** HNSW (LanceDB top-K), cascading writes, std hashing, CoW-via-SQLite-WAL+Lance, Phi-4-mini at consolidation, BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedder, Tantivy BM25 + RRF + abstain.
- **Added this arc:** connected-components topic discovery (C), token-budgeted structured packing at read (B), startup wiring + CLI subcommand.
- **Deferring:** Cuckoo filters (sync, V0.2.9-13); per-tenant sharding / consensus / replication (V1.0+ Managed — prefer managed Postgres/Spanner over hand-rolled Raft).
- **Dropped (wrong tool):** Bloom filters, Z-order/Morton, quad trees, skip lists, external sorting.
- **Dead:** speculative decoding + the 120s p99 ceiling (Qwen is out of the read path).

The lock SIMPLIFIED the menu. The vault needs brilliant plumbing (filter + structure + pack), not exotic structures.

## 8 · 🐛 Tech debt — open items (live forward-pointers)

Full narrative for each in PART2 archive ("Tech debt — open items"). File pointers kept here so they don't lose their anchor.

1. **Read-relevance: per-candidate cosine filter + carry-cosine-through-fusion + retire vestigial BM25 gate.** Carry raw semantic cosine through `HybridRetriever` fusion onto `RetrievedMemory` (today `hybrid.rs:221-247` discards it), then filter per-candidate → removes double-embed, enables per-candidate precision filtering, lets the BM25 gate be retired. Closely related to Thread 2. Files: `vault-retrieval/src/strategies/hybrid.rs:221-247`, `structured_read_pipeline.rs`, `strategies/abstain.rs`. (Surfaced ADR-057)
2. **🟢 LARGELY CLOSED 2026-06-14 (ADR-078, §8.10).** Entity-extraction-at-consolidation is now BUILT — the consolidator extracts + writes entities + relationships per fact via the combined Phi-4 enrichment call (`phases/extract.rs` + `enrich_facts`). **Remaining tail:** `GraphStore::rewrite_relationships_for_memory(old, new)` for the merge path — a fact whose *content* changes re-extracts but leaves the prior content's relationships behind; `apply_merge` still has its graph-update `tracing::warn!` no-op (`phases/merge.rs::apply_merge`). Low priority while the graph is dogfood-only. Do NOT amend the BRD until the merge-rewrite tail closes.
   - **🚧 TRIPWIRE — DO NOT wire graph traversal into the read/answer path until BOTH hold (added 2026-06-15 after Shahbaz flagged "tech-debt that silently breaks the pipeline later"):** (a) the merge-path rewrite above is implemented; AND (b) graph **extraction completeness** is measured at scale. **Evidence (2026-06-15 tiny-vault scheduler run):** of 6 facts, Phi-4 produced clean entities+relationships for 5 but an **empty/incomplete graph for the Tesla fact** — its `drives`→`Tesla Model 3` edge was dropped as a dangling link (`extract.rs:219` requires both endpoints be listed entities). Root cause = **Phi-4 per-fact output variance**, NOT a code bug: `enrich_facts` processes every active fact and the lossiness is fully **instrumented** (`EnrichmentReport.{entities_created, relationships_failed, graph_write_failures, facts_failed}`) — it is counted, not silent, and CANNOT affect output today (graph is write-only in V0.2, not consumed at read). So the graph is **best-effort / incomplete by construction**; trusting it for answers before measuring + hardening extraction (prompt tuning / retry / completeness eval) would surface incomplete graph answers. This tripwire is the guard against exactly that. **Entity_type-stored-as-JSON-with-quotes was investigated 2026-06-15 and is NOT a bug** — `graph_store.rs:251-258` round-trips `EntityType` via `serde_json` symmetrically (`"person"` on disk ↔ `EntityType::Person` in memory); no fix needed.
3. **`VaultError::Storage(String)` grab-bag → structured variants.** `retry_queue.rs::is_permanent` substring-matches lance error wording (fragile; lance 4.0 wording is inconsistent). Add `SchemaMismatch`/`IoFailure`/etc., re-categorise ~30 call sites, rewrite `is_permanent` as exhaustive `match` + tripwire test. Files: `retry_queue.rs:240-275`, `vault-core/src/error.rs:139`, the ~30 `Storage(format!(...))` sites.
4. **✅ CLOSED 2026-06-13 (ADR-076, §8.8).** `pending_sync` sweep + migration 0003 cascade payload. Migration 0003 added `sequence_id` + `payload`; the overflow path persists the full cascade and `StorageBackend::drain_pending_sync` re-enqueues it (the `DivergenceDetector` Tier-0 sweep). The V0.2-sync ship-gate is met. (Note: stored the raw cascade `payload` rather than the sketched `embedding`/`boundary` columns — more faithful + version-agnostic.)
5. **Cosine NaN-vector lance upstream issue (LOW — community citizenship).** lance 4.0 filters NaN-distance rows from Cosine search (zero-magnitude vectors). Production unaffected (BGE vectors are L2-normalised, never zero). File a minimal-repro issue against `lancedb/lance`. File: `vector_store.rs:1248-1263`.
6. **🟡 Min-fix LANDED 2026-06-13 (`--test-threads=1` added to `ci.yml:702`); verify on the next Monday cron. Deeper unique-`.partial` fix still open (LOW).** Weekly real-model smoke red since 2026-05-18 — concurrent-download race (CI-infra, NOT a code regression). The `real-model-smoke` weekly cron job (`ci.yml:702`, `cargo test -p vault-llm -- --ignored`) has failed every Monday across 4 unrelated commits (`4ae8dbd`/`93d1410`/`2302842`/`a3e426b`). Root cause (source-confirmed): all 3 smoke tests run concurrently (no `--test-threads=1`) and `model_loader.rs::download_with_verify` writes to a **single shared** `.partial` path (`model_loader.rs:131`) then renames to final (`:156`); the winner's rename leaves the losers' rename hitting a vanished `.partial` → `Io NotFound code 2`. The test's own doc (`phi4_mini_smoke.rs:47-48`) assumes serial execution. **Min fix (CI-only):** add `--test-threads=1` to `ci.yml:702` — verifiable only via next Monday cron or a `run-llm-smoke`-labelled PR. **Deeper latent bug (LOW, prod single-writer + pre-download mitigates):** the shared `.partial` path means two cold-starting agent processes could corrupt each other's download — make `.partial` unique per download + treat "final already present after our stream" as success. Matters because this job is the ONLY CI coverage of the real Phi-4 consolidator path (dark for a month); re-light before leaning on the consolidator (roadmap §5 item 2). Files: `ci.yml:702`, `model_loader.rs:95-160`.

7. **`graph.duckdb` plaintext + native-encryption dead-end (LOW — graph empty in V0.2).** DuckDB native encryption can't write an encrypted DB offline on any bundled version (mbedtls is read-only; secure write needs the network `httpfs`/OpenSSL extension). Real path: bundle the httpfs/OpenSSL helper INSIDE the app and `LOAD` it from a local file. Fold into the Pillar-3 sync security review or whenever the graph first holds shippable data. (ADR-078 §8.10.)
8. **🔁 SUPERSEDED 2026-06-15 — `/FI _SECURE_SCL` shim REMOVED, replaced by a v143 (14.44) MSVC toolset pin (LOW — CI-infra workaround, pending CI-green verification).** The shim (`.github/msvc_fmt_secure_scl_shim.h` + the two `CXXFLAGS_*` steps, ADR-079) was a dead end: it only reached DuckDB's cc-rs build and leaked a feature macro into llama.cpp's ggml → a 2nd VS2026 break (`std::hardware_destructive_interference_size`). **Fix (Option 2):** keep the tuned `windows-2025` image but pin the MSVC toolset to **v143 = 14.44** (the VS2022-era compatibility toolset still shipped on the VS2026 image — the exact compiler that produced the last green CI `d613614`) via `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1` (`toolset: '14.44'`) on ALL 3 Windows jobs (clippy, build-and-test, real-model-smoke). This fixes BOTH the DuckDB fmt AND the ggml break at the root (cc-rs + Ninja/CMake both pick up the pinned `cl.exe`/INCLUDE/LIB). Shim file deleted. **The thing to remove later is now the toolset pin** — drop it once `libduckdb-sys` vendors a newer fmt AND `llama-cpp-sys-2` supports VS2026. Files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (header comment + the 3 `Pin MSVC toolset to v143` steps). **Residual risk (CI-only-validated):** if cc-rs ignores the vcvars env and re-derives VS2026 via vswhere for the DuckDB build, the DuckDB compile could still pick 14.51 — watch the first CI run's libduckdb-sys log; if so, add a cc-rs-specific toolset hint.

Also tracked as SHIPPED-design-record in PART2 archive: `bulk_upsert` promotion to the `VectorStore` trait (730× faster bulk insert, shipped `c091281`).

## 8.5 · 🆕 ADR-073 (IN FLIGHT) — recall-safe `memory_read`: reorder-only + separation/no-signal abstain hint, never hard-empty

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-06-08 (committing; CI pending). All 5 DoD gates green (fmt/build-0-warn/clippy-0-lint/vault-retrieval 80+6 tests/vault-mcp 41 tests). **Live-verified on the 1k vault across BOTH model tiers** (Flash + Opus): "how do i stay fit" now ANSWERS via `memory_read` (was `abstain:true` empty); blood-type/OS/salary still abstain with no fabrication; cat→dog surfaces the dog helpfully. Fixes Thread-2 Gap 1 (§4). Amends ADR-054 (read response shape, additive) + ADR-066 (recall-first read) + supersedes the ADR-059 read-side floor-drop. Full text stays here until the next archive freeze. (Gap 2 still open — see §4.)

**Context.** 1k live dogfood proved `memory_read` false-abstains on stored facts: `apply_reranker` (`structured_read_pipeline.rs`) hard-drops every candidate below `reranker.relevance_floor()` (≈ logit −2.5) and sets `abstain = candidates.is_empty()`. Real answers score below that floor ("runs 10km" for "stay fit" = logit −3.21) → dropped → false-abstain. Meanwhile `memory_search` (`RerankedRetriever`) is reorder-only + never empties and got these right. The two paths diverged; read must converge to search's recall-safe behavior. (Evidence: [[project_1k_live_read_false_abstain]].)

**Decision.**
1. **`apply_reranker` becomes reorder-only** — mirror `RerankedRetriever::rerank_pool`: sigmoid-map each logit to `[0,1]`, keep ALL candidates, sort by relevance DESC. No floor-drop. (The `RERANK_CANDIDATE_CAP` truncation stays — it bounds reranker cost, doesn't hide answers.)
2. **`abstain` is computed by a combined hint, not a drop** — `abstain = candidates.is_empty() || weak_match`, where `weak_match` is TRUE when EITHER (a) `top_relevance < READ_NO_SIGNAL_FLOOR` (≈0.01; catches lone/few no-signal facts the Lisbon-guard + cat→dog class), OR (b) the top is not separated from the pool per `search_hint`'s rule (top < `STRONG_RELEVANCE` 0.5 AND top < `SEPARATION_RATIO` 3× the runner-up; catches flat clusters like the salary trap). Separation alone is insufficient (a lone no-signal fact reads as "separated") — hence the floor; the floor alone is insufficient (the 0.025 salary cluster clears it) — hence separation. Both, combined.
3. **Never hard-empty `relevant_facts`** — when retrieval returned candidates, they are ALWAYS returned (reordered, truncated to `max_candidates`), even when `abstain=true`. The floor governs only the abstain HINT, never whether a fact is shown — so a mis-set floor can never hide a real answer (recall-safety by construction; the cardinal rule holds regardless of floor placement). The agent judges; the cat→dog live case proved a capable agent abstains-in-prose correctly when given facts + an honest hint.
4. **Response gains `top_relevance: f32`** (the rank-1 relevance for agent transparency). `abstain` IS read's weak-match signal — refined from "facts empty" to "no confident match; the facts shown (if any) are low-confidence." (No separate `weak_match` field — it would be identical to `abstain`; `top_relevance` carries the nuance, mirroring `memory_search`'s hint.)

**Thresholds (all backed by the 1k live data, none guessed):** real answers ranged relevance 0.0388–0.99; no-signal/wrong-neighbor 0.00006–0.004; salary distractor cluster 0.014–0.025 flat. `READ_NO_SIGNAL_FLOOR = 0.01` sits in the ~10× gap between the lowest real answer (0.0388) and the highest no-signal (0.004); `STRONG_RELEVANCE`/`SEPARATION_RATIO` reuse `search_hint`'s pinned 0.5 / 3×.

**Not chosen:** (a) lowering the existing floor-drop threshold — still drops real answers below it, still hard-false-abstains; rejected because recall must be unconditional. (b) Pure `search_hint` separation (no floor) — false-ANSWERS on lone no-signal facts (Lisbon-guard / cat→dog). (c) A redundant `weak_match` field — identical to `abstain`. (d) Touching the no-reranker cosine-gate fallback — out of scope; that path's `Vec::new()`-on-below-floor still maps to `abstain=true`+empty, unchanged.

**Security:** no crypto/boundary-filter change; boundary authorization upstream is untouched.

**Harness note:** `scale_eval` greenwashed this (measured pool recall, not the live `memory_read` gate, with favorable phrasings). Part of this work updates the harness to call the real tool + assert on `abstain`/`relevant_facts`/`top_relevance` + add paraphrase query variants.

**Tests changed (contract change — surfaced, not silent):** `reranker_filters_candidates_below_floor` (now: both kept, keep-ranked-first, reorder-only), `reranker_abstains_when_all_candidates_below_floor` (now: abstain=true BUT fact still present + low top_relevance), `union_semantic_recall_rescues_keyword_starved_fact` (now: distractor also kept, cello ranked #1, abstain=false). New tests: stay-fit-class (low-but-separated → abstain=false + fact present), salary-class (flat cluster → abstain=true + facts present), no-signal-floor (lone deep-negative → abstain=true + fact present), top_relevance field population.

## 8.6 · 🆕 ADR-074 (IN FLIGHT) — document-side alias enrichment at consolidation (Gap-2 vocabulary-gap fix)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-10; **all 5 DoD gates green** (fmt / build-0-warn / clippy-0-lint / `vault-consolidator` 113 tests incl. 13 new `enrich` / `vault-app` 58 tests). NOT yet committed; live rank-lift validation with the real Phi-4 model is the next step. Fixes Thread-2 Gap 2 (§4 / §4.2). Honours [[project_architectural_lock_llm_out_of_read_path]] (Phi-4 at consolidation only) + [[project_locked_next_arc_t03x]] (consolidator arc). Full text stays here until the next archive freeze.

**Context.** Ground-truth probing of the real `seeded-vault-1k` (2026-06-09) re-diagnosed Gap 2 as a **vocabulary gap**: a fact phrased without the obvious keyword ("settled in **Porto**", "raising **twins**") is outranked by — or in a dense-distractor field drops below — facts carrying the literal keyword. The agent's keyword-soup query is the *trigger*, so query-side expansion was FALSIFIED (it replicates the harmful soup). The `probe_enrichment` A/B proved the fix is **document-side**: bare Porto ABSENT → enriched Porto rank 1 @ 0.9965 on the killer query; twins rank 5 → 1; no regression. Evidence: [[project_1k_live_paraphrase_recall_miss]].

**Decision — Option B (Phi-4 at consolidation), NOT write-time agent aliases (Option A):** the proven miss is an *existing* fact (write-time aliases only help future writes), and write-time leans on agent-generated aliases (the lever this session proved unreliable). Three locked parts:

1. **Alias generation (`phases/enrich.rs::generate_aliases`).** One `LlmProvider::complete_json` call per fact — mirrors `topics::label_one_cluster` (temp 0, fixed seed `0x0A11_A5E5`, `max_tokens` 64, JSON schema `{"aliases":[4..8 strings]}`, JSON-only system prompt). Asks for alternative search keywords NOT already prominent in the text (synonym / category / type). Output normalised to trimmed lowercase, de-blanked. Empty/malformed → `Err` (skip-and-retry, never run-abort).
2. **Storage + embed-text (`metadata` key + composition).** Aliases stored on `Memory.metadata.enrichment = {"aliases": "a, b, c", "content_fp": "<fnv1a-hex>"}` (no schema migration — `metadata` is free-form `serde_json`; existing keys preserved). The **embedded** text is `compose_embed_text` = `"<content> Topics: <aliases>"` (the proven probe shape, pinned by `compose_embed_text_matches_probe_shape`). **`Memory.content` (display text) is NEVER modified** → the alias line cannot leak into the read response (read returns `content`). Aliases are a **vector-channel boost only**; BM25 still indexes clean `content`. The persisted vector is replaced in-place via `StorageBackend::update_memory` (atomic metadata + vector update, by id).
3. **When it runs / cost (`Consolidator::enrich_facts`).** A new consolidator step over the active (non-superseded, non-invalidated) set, wired in the app-layer safety wrapper AFTER `run_consolidation` and BEFORE `generate_reports` (parallels `generate_reports`; under the same 30-min timeout). **Idempotent:** each fact records an FNV-1a `content_fp`; a fact already enriched for its current content is skipped, so the first run backfills the whole vault and steady-state runs only re-embed newly-written / changed facts (a merge or update mints fresh content → fresh fingerprint → re-enrich). FNV-1a (not `DefaultHasher`) is stable across toolchain versions → no spurious whole-vault re-embed after a Rust upgrade.

**Failure + operational semantics (locked-next-arc Step 4):** a per-fact LLM / embed / `update_memory` failure is logged-and-counted (`EnrichmentReport::facts_failed`) and the loop continues — one bad fact never aborts the run, and the fact retries next cycle (no fingerprint written). Two operational notes from tracing the real path: (a) **first backfill on a large vault can exceed the 30-min consolidator timeout** (~1k facts × ~3–5s/Phi-4 call); because each `update_memory` commits immediately and the pass is idempotent, a timed-out run still makes durable progress and **re-running resumes** (self-heals over 2–3 runs — no per-run cap added; alpha-scale vaults of a few hundred facts finish in one run). (b) **Re-embeds drain async** through the cascade queue (like merges today), so the one-shot `vault-cli consolidate run` exits before the new vectors land; they apply when a worker next opens the vault (restart Antigravity / MCP server).

**Not chosen:** (a) write-time agent aliases (Option A — doesn't fix existing facts; relies on the unreliable agent-alias lever). (b) Vault-side query expansion (FALSIFIED — IS the keyword-soup that triggers the miss). (c) A deterministic synonym map ("settled in Porto" → "home" needs comprehension, not a thesaurus). (d) Putting aliases into `content` (would leak into display + pollute BM25). (e) A per-run enrichment cap (YAGNI at alpha scale; timeout-resume already bounds risk — revisit if the live 1k run shows timeout pain).

**Security:** no crypto / boundary-filter change. Enrichment operates within a single boundary's facts via the existing storage traits; the alias text is derived from the fact's own content by the local Phi-4 (no cross-boundary read, no network).

**Live validation — DONE 2026-06-10, real Phi-4, real 1k vault.** Two `#[ignore]` probes ride with this commit: `vault-consolidator` `real_phi4_alias_quality` (loads the real GGUF, prints aliases for the killer facts) and `vault-app` `scale_eval::probe_real_enrichment_1k` (drops the 3 keyword-poor killers into a throwaway `seeded-vault-1k` copy, records bare rank, enriches ONLY them via the real `enrich_one` path, re-measures by direct LanceDB vector search — fast A/B, no full-vault enrichment / merge-cost). **Result (real Phi-4 aliases, 1k dense field):**

| killer | killer query | bare | → enriched |
|---|---|---|---|
| Porto ("settled in Porto") | "home location city country lives residence" | **ABSENT (>top-50)** | **rank 1** |
| twins ("raising twins") | "children kids son daughter offspring family" | rank 1 | rank 1 |

**Prompt-tuning finding (the reason to validate-before-commit):** the *first* real-Phi-4 run lifted Porto only ABSENT→rank 6 — Phi-4 returned Portugal-anchored *phrases* (`portugal residence change`) instead of the generic single words the query uses. Tuned `generate_aliases` to ask for **single-word generic category/type keywords** (neutral job/pet examples, NOT the eval cases) → Porto's aliases became `portugal, settlement, residence, city, relocation, migration` → **rank 1**, hives/twins unchanged.

## 8.7 · 🆕 ADR-075 (IN FLIGHT) — Phase 4 confidence decay (T0.2.4)

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-06-13; all 4 DoD gates green (fresh DuckDB-1.4 build 0-warn / `vault-storage` + `vault-consolidator` tests 0-fail / clippy 0-lint / fmt). Implements BRD §5.6 Phase 4 line 994 (the *decay* half; cold archive deferred). Honours [[project_architectural_lock_llm_out_of_read_path]] (no LLM in decay).

**Context.** Phase 4 was unbuilt (`memories_archived` hardcoded 0; no decay pass). The sleep consolidator must fade stale knowledge so retrieval (which weights by confidence) demotes it over time without ever deleting it.

**Decision.**
1. **Policy (`phases/decay.rs::plan_decay`)** — a fact not accessed in `decay_after_days` (180) has `confidence ×= 0.9` (BRD line 994 verbatim). Pure planner over the active set; skips superseded / invalidated facts and 0.0-confidence no-ops.
2. **Metadata-only application (`StorageBackend::apply_decay`)** — sets confidence + an idempotency marker (`metadata.decay.last_decay_at`); **never re-embeds** (re-embedding from raw `content` would clobber the ADR-074 enriched vector). New `memory.decayed` audit event distinguishes a decay from a user edit.
3. **Idempotency (BRD line 1022)** — the marker means a back-to-back run does not re-decay; a fact re-decays only after a full decay period elapses.
4. **Wiring** — runs as Phase 4 in `run_consolidation` (after contradiction, before report); `ConsolidationReport.memories_decayed` + the summary Decay section carry the count.

**Cold archive (BRD lines 995-996) DEFERRED** — a first-class `Memory` state change (schema + retrieval-filter reach) far larger than decay; its own batch keeps this one debuggable. `memories_archived` stays 0.

**Tests:** 10 planner + 3 `apply_decay` + 2 summary + 1 real-BGE end-to-end (`cold_fact_decays_through_consolidation_and_is_never_lost`). The "no memory ever lost" property holds — decay only mutates confidence.

## 8.8 · 🆕 ADR-076 (IN FLIGHT) — sync ship-gate: `pending_sync` cascade payload (migration 0003)

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-06-13; 4 gates green. **Closes tech-debt #4** (V0.2 sync ship-gate).

**Context.** `DivergenceDetector::sweep_pending_sync` was a V0.1 stub returning 0 — the cap-overflow catch-up table carried only `(memory_id, operation, queued_at)`, not enough to reconstruct a `retry_queue` row. Cross-device churn (V0.2 sync) makes a silently-dropped overflow entry a real data-recovery gap.

**Decision.**
1. **Migration 0003** adds `sequence_id INTEGER` + `payload BLOB` to `pending_sync` (nullable / defaulted — legacy rows read NULL payload and are *skipped*, never re-enqueued broken).
2. **Overflow path persists the full cascade** — both overflow call sites pass the in-scope `audit_seq` + `payload_bytes` to `tx_upsert_pending_sync`.
3. **Real sweep (`StorageBackend::drain_pending_sync`)** — oldest-first, atomically per entry: while `retry_queue` < cap, re-insert the stored cascade + delete the pending row in one tx. Stops at cap; payload-less rows skipped. `DivergenceDetector` calls it as Tier-0.

**Deviation from the handoff sketch:** stored the cascade **payload (+ `sequence_id`)** rather than separate `embedding`/`boundary` columns — more faithful (the stored bytes hand straight back to the retry insert) and schema-version-agnostic.

**Security:** payload lives in the SQLCipher-encrypted `vault.db` — encrypted at rest, no new plaintext surface, no crypto-path change.

**Tests:** full overflow → drop-vector → sweep → worker-reapply → vector-restored loop; payload-less legacy skip; payload round-trip; migration-columns check.

## 8.9 · 🆕 ADR-077 (IN FLIGHT) — DuckDB 1.2.2 → 1.10503.1 (libduckdb 1.4 LTS) upgrade

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-06-13; 4 gates green on a **fresh full-workspace cold build** (`cargo clean` first).

**Context.** DuckDB 1.4 LTS (Sept 2025) adds native database encryption (`ATTACH … (ENCRYPTION_KEY …)`, AES-256-GCM over the main file + WAL + temp files) — the clean path to closing the V0.2 graph-encryption gap (`graph_store.rs:41-42`), which pinned 1.2.2 could not do.

**Decision.** Adopt the dependency upgrade **now** (de-risked on a clean rebuild of the whole workspace), but **DEFER the encryption wiring** (the `ATTACH ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `graph_store.rs` + ADR-SEC + §11 threat-model review + security tests) to its own task. Lands the heavy/risky dep bump on a verified clean tree so the later encryption work is pure code, not a dep gamble.

**Verification.** Spike built `vault-storage` clean (17m36s, exit 0). Then a full `cargo clean` + fresh `cargo build --workspace -D warnings` compiled **all 12 crates** against 1.4 (29m57s, 0 warnings); tests + clippy green.

**Cost accepted (`Cargo.lock` churn):** arrow 54→58 (workspace now carries arrow 57 **and** 58 — lance stays on 57; they don't cross paths), strum 0.25→0.27, + new crossterm / zip / zopfli / zlib-rs. The Cargo.toml CRT-conflict note (esaxx-rs `/MT` vs duckdb-sys `/MD`) is unaffected — `esaxx_fast` is already dropped.

**Next task (graph encryption — still deferred):** wire `ATTACH 'graph.duckdb' (ENCRYPTION_KEY <derived from master key>)` + ADR-SEC entry + §11 threat-model walk + security tests.

## 8.10 · 🆕 ADR-078 (IN FLIGHT) — graph-filling: entity + relationship extraction at consolidation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-06-14; all DoD gates green on a fresh `cargo clean` full-workspace rebuild (DuckDB 1.4.4). **Closes tech-debt #2** (entity-extraction-at-consolidation). Honours [[project_architectural_lock_llm_out_of_read_path]] (Phi-4 at consolidation only) + [[project_locked_next_arc_t03x]] (consolidator arc). Full text stays here until the next archive freeze.

**Corrects ADR-077 (§8.9):** that ADR's "libduckdb 1.4 LTS" label was WRONG — `=1.10503.1` is **DuckDB 1.5.3** (off-LTS; its bundled C++ fails the Windows CI `fmt/format.h` compile → `a1c0ff9` is CI-RED). Pin corrected to `=1.4.4` (the real LTS). ADR-077's encryption goal is **falsified by spike**: NO bundled DuckDB version can securely write an encrypted DB offline (mbedtls is read-only; secure write needs the network `httpfs`/OpenSSL extension → breaks offline/zero-knowledge — confirmed on 1.4.4 AND 1.5.3). Graph encryption deferred to "bundle the helper locally, when the graph holds shippable data" (tech-debt #7). A `rstrtmgr` link fix (`vault-storage/build.rs`) covers DuckDB 1.4's `AdditionalLockInfo` → Windows Restart-Manager dependency that `libduckdb-sys` forgot to link.

**Context.** The DuckDB `GraphStore` (entities + bi-temporal relationships) shipped at T0.1.5 but nothing ever FILLED it — `apply_merge` skipped the graph with a `tracing::warn!` no-op (tech-debt #2), so `graph.duckdb` held zero data. Product reason to fill it now (Shahbaz, 2026-06-14): the graph must hold real data before it (and its eventual encryption) is worth anything; "it's empty so don't encrypt it" is unbuilt work, not a feature.

**Decision — extract via the EXISTING enrichment call, not a new pass.** The nightly enrichment (ADR-074) already sends every fact to Phi-4 once (for search aliases). A separate extraction pass would DOUBLE the per-fact LLM cost and worsen the ~90-fact latency wall. Instead the one call now returns three products: `aliases` + `entities` + `relationships`. **Validated by a live tuned Phi-4 probe** (`phases::enrich::real_phi4_combined_extraction_quality`, `#[ignore]`): combined output keeps single-word keyword quality (no recall regression) and produces correctly-typed entities + sensibly-directed links. Three parts:

1. **Combined call (`phases/enrich.rs`).** `generate_aliases` → `generate_enrichment` returning `{aliases, graph}`; one `complete_json` against a schema carrying all three arrays (entity `type` enum = `EntityType` snake_case names). Aliases stay recall-critical (empty aliases ⇒ `Err`/retry); the graph is best-effort (empty ⇒ no error). `EnrichedFact` gains a `graph: ExtractedGraph` field.
2. **Parse + cleanup + write (NEW `phases/extract.rs`).** `parse_extracted` is best-effort (NEVER errors): maps the type label (unknown ⇒ `Concept`, never `Custom` junk), drops empty/over-long names, dedups entities, normalises relations to snake_case, and **drops any relationship whose endpoints are not in the entity list** (the model occasionally references an unlisted name). `write_extracted_to_graph` **gets-or-creates** each entity (new `GraphStore::get_entity` lookup) so nightly re-runs reuse ids instead of hitting the `(name, type, boundary)` UNIQUE constraint, then creates the relationships — all scoped to the memory's own `Boundary` (ADR-015 privacy holds).
3. **Wiring (`consolidator.rs::enrich_facts`).** After `update_memory` persists the enriched vector, the graph is written. **Ordering is load-bearing:** vector first (writes the `content_fp` fingerprint), graph second — so a transient graph-write failure is never re-extracted into DUPLICATE edges on the next run. `EnrichmentReport` gains `entities_created` / `entities_reused` / `relationships_created` / `relationships_failed` / `graph_write_failures`.

**Idempotency.** Extraction rides inside the fingerprint-gated `enrich_one`, so a steady-state run never re-extracts an unchanged fact → no duplicate entities/relationships (proven by the `enrich_facts_fills_graph_with_entities_and_relationships` e2e: fact → linked entities, traversable, second run = zero duplicates).

**Not chosen / deferred:** (a) a separate extraction LLM pass (doubles latency); (b) a local NER model (no NER lib in-tree; Phi-4 already loaded at consolidation); (c) **relationship-rewrite-on-merge** — a content change (merge/update) re-extracts but leaves the prior content's relationships behind; retiring them needs the `rewrite_relationships_for_memory` primitive (tech-debt #2's tail) — out of scope for this milestone, harmless while the graph is dogfood-only; (d) graph encryption (deferred — see above).

**Security:** no crypto / boundary-filter change. Extraction operates within a single boundary's facts via the existing `GraphStore` traits; entity/relationship text is derived from the fact's own content by the local Phi-4 (no cross-boundary read, no network). `create_relationship`'s ADR-015 cross-boundary guard is untouched.

**Tests:** `vault-storage` `get_entity` ×4 (absent / full-fidelity / type+boundary scoping / get-or-create no-dup); `vault-consolidator` `phases::extract` ×8 (label mapping, relation normalisation, dangling-drop, case-insensitive endpoint resolve, dedup + self-loop drop, malformed-safe) + the `enrich_facts` e2e graph-fill + existing enrichment tests green (no regression).

## 8.11 · 🆕 ADR-079 (IN FLIGHT) — Windows CI fix: VS2026 removed `stdext::checked_array_iterator` (bundled-DuckDB fmt break)

**Status:** committing now; CI-only change, NOT locally testable (see below). Restores `main` to green after two consecutive RED commits (`a1c0ff9`, `d2b9b9b`). Corrects the ADR-078/§1 misdiagnosis that the DuckDB pin caused the Windows red.

**Root cause (proven from CI run `27484651556` logs + cross-checked upstream).** GitHub's `windows-2025` runner image migrated to **Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC 14.51.36231)** during the 2026-06-08→06-15 rollout (the build log path is `Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Enterprise`). VS 2026 **removed** `stdext::checked_array_iterator` from the MSVC STL headers entirely (a long-deprecated non-Standard extension; confirmed removed, not merely deprecated — see o3de/o3de#19754: *"these functions literally do not exist anymore"*). DuckDB's bundled `fmt` (~v5.x, vendored in `libduckdb-sys`) still references it under a bare `#ifdef _SECURE_SCL`; VS 2026 **still defines** `_SECURE_SCL`, so the bundled C++ build takes that branch and fails:

```text
fmt/format.h(326): error C2061: syntax error: identifier 'checked_array_iterator'
```

This is independent of DuckDB version — `1.4.4` AND `1.5.3` bundle the same ancient fmt, so neither the `=1.10503.1→=1.4.4` correction nor any crate bump escapes it. The last green commit (`d613614`, 2026-06-10) predates the image migration; nothing in our code regressed. `_SILENCE_STDEXT_ARR_ITERS_DEPRECATION_WARNING` does NOT help (the type is gone, not deprecated; and the build already uses `-W0`).

**Decision.** A forced-include (`/FI`) shim header (`.github/msvc_fmt_secure_scl_shim.h`) `#include`s `<yvals.h>` (which sets `_SECURE_SCL` and has an include guard) then `#undef _SECURE_SCL`; later STL includes are guard-no-ops, so the macro stays undefined and fmt falls back to its raw-pointer `checked_ptr = T*` branch — the exact path Linux/macOS already compile (known-good; DuckDB builds clean there). Wired into BOTH Windows CI jobs (clippy + build/test) via `CXXFLAGS_x86_64_pc_windows_msvc`, which **cc-rs (libduckdb-sys) reads but CMake (llama-cpp-sys-2's Vulkan build) does not** — so the llama/Vulkan build, the reason we are on `windows-2025` at all, is untouched.

**Not chosen:** (a) the silence macro (type removed, not deprecated); (b) a DuckDB crate bump (same bundled fmt across versions); (c) reverting to `windows-2022` (re-breaks the llama `vulkan-shaders-gen` C1083 build — the documented reason for `windows-2025`); (d) pinning an older MSVC v143 toolset (re-introduces toolset/CMake interaction risk, larger blast radius); (e) hand-writing a `checked_array_iterator` replacement (error-prone vs. just disabling the dead branch).

**Local-test relaxation (per Shahbaz, 2026-06-14 session 2).** The failure is specific to the CI runner's VS 2026 image and **cannot be reproduced on the founder's local machine** (older MSVC that still ships the type — local builds were green throughout). So local DoD gates verify nothing here; CI is the only meaningful verification. Committed + pushed without a local build run by explicit founder direction; CI-green is the gate. **Risk if wrong:** the `<yvals.h>`-defines-`_SECURE_SCL` assumption is the one empirical link not provable locally — if a different header defines it, CI fails the same way and we iterate.

**Security:** none — build-time compiler flag only, no runtime/crypto/boundary surface.

**Tech debt:** remove the shim + CI step once `libduckdb-sys` vendors a newer fmt (or drops the `stdext` usage). Tracked as tech-debt #8.

## 8.12 · 🆕 ADR-080 (IN FLIGHT) — consolidator scheduling (T0.2.6): production scheduler is app-layer

**Status:** BUILT 2026-06-14; all 5 DoD gates green locally on a fresh cold build. UNCOMMITTED pending end-to-end + dogfood test (§1 opener). Implements BRD §5.6 line 953 (`Consolidator::schedule`) + the `scheduler.rs` slot + the §6 "Scheduling — Not built" gap. Honours [[project_architectural_lock_llm_out_of_read_path]] (Phi-4 at consolidation only).

**Context.** `Consolidator::schedule()` was a `todo!()` panic stub and nothing triggered consolidation automatically — the nightly brain only ran when manually invoked. T0.2.6 makes the vault self-maintaining.

**Decision — the production scheduler lives in `vault-app`, not `Consolidator::schedule()`.** The dependency rule (app → consolidator, never upward) forces this: the full *correct* nightly pipeline needs the app-only cross-process lockfile, the 30-min timeout, the ADR-074 enrichment pass, and per-boundary REPORT-to-disk — and the consolidator is filesystem-agnostic by architecture lock, so it cannot call `Application::run_consolidation_with_safety`. If `schedule()` were the trigger it would silently skip enrichment + REPORTs → incorrect output. So:

1. **`vault-consolidator/src/scheduler.rs` (NEW)** — pure timing: `next_run_after(now, run_at)` (strict-after, so firing exactly at `run_at` schedules tomorrow, never an immediate re-fire) + `duration_until_next_run(now: DateTime<Local>, run_at)`. No async / no clock side-effects → exhaustively unit-testable (7 tests: today/tomorrow/exact-match/one-second-before/month+year rollover/positive-and-bounded/delta-match). BRD §5.6 `run_at` is local time, so arithmetic is local (one-night DST slop accepted at alpha scale).
2. **`Consolidator::schedule()`** — implemented as the headless loop (sleep via the helper → `run_consolidation` → `enrich_facts`; a failed run is logged and the loop waits for the next `run_at`, never tears down). Infinite loop; the `VaultResult<()>` return matches the BRD signature. Documented as the library/embedder path; the app does not call it.
3. **App-layer production scheduler (`application.rs`)** — extracted `run_consolidation_under_safety(consolidator, vault_root)` from the existing method (both the method and the scheduler now call it); a shutdown-aware `run_consolidator_schedule` loop mirrors the proven `RetryWorker::run` pattern (`select!` on `sleep(wait)` vs `cancel.changed()` so Ctrl-C is prompt); spawned in `start_with_mcp` **only when a consolidator is configured**, tracked on `ApplicationHandle.consolidator_handle`, aborted + awaited in `shutdown()`.

**Latency explicitly out of scope (Shahbaz, 2026-06-14).** Correctness of wiring first; the 30-min budget / incremental-phase work is deferred. A scheduled full run on the ~90-fact dev vault may exceed 30 min today — acceptable for now (idempotent passes self-heal; the timeout is a safety guard, not a correctness gate). Revisit latency after the core is proven correct via dogfood.

**Not chosen:** (a) the loop in `Consolidator::schedule()` as the production path (skips enrichment + REPORT — incorrect output); (b) a callback-param on `schedule()` (would diverge from the BRD signature); (c) an external cron (thesis violation — BRD §1.4 "we do not host scheduled cron jobs"; the in-process tokio scheduler is the local-first equivalent); (d) chasing the 30-min budget now (latency deferred).

**Security:** none — scheduling is timing only; the run it triggers reuses the unchanged `run_consolidation_with_safety` path (lockfile + boundary-scoped storage traits).

**Tests:** `vault_consolidator::scheduler` ×7 (pure timing). The auto-scheduler *firing* has no unit test (a 24 h wait isn't testable) — validated live in the §1 STEP-1/STEP-3 dogfood instead, with reasoning recorded here rather than a brittle paused-clock integration test.

## 8.13 · 🆕 ADR-081 (IN FLIGHT) — Checkpoint & Rollback (T0.2.5): capture-by-diff, enrichment excluded, top-level CLI

**Status:** BUILT 2026-06-16; all 5 DoD gates green on a fresh `cargo clean` cold build. UNCOMMITTED at time of writing. Closes the T0.2.5 "undo a bad nightly run" gap (BRD §5.6 line 998 + §6.2). Full text stays here until the next archive freeze.

**Context.** The vault now self-runs the nightly consolidation (T0.2.6 scheduler, ADR-080). A bad run (an over-eager merge, a wrong contradiction call) would silently corrupt the user's memory with no recourse — the trust-critical gap for unattended beta. A2 records, every run, an undo-log of exactly what changed, restorable by id.

**Decision.**
1. **Storage layer owns the checkpoint store** (`vault-storage/src/checkpoint.rs`): `create_checkpoint` (insert + prune to N=7, one txn), `rollback_checkpoint` (load → restore 'modified' via the existing `update_memory`, delete 'created' via `delete_memory`, mark `rolled_back` — three separate txns so the metadata lock is never held across the cascading writes, which would deadlock), `list_checkpoints`. Pre-image = versioned `{Memory, embedding}` blob in the SQLCipher DB (inherits zero-knowledge encryption-at-rest). Tables: migration v4.
2. **Capture is a before/after DIFF** (`vault-consolidator/src/checkpoint.rs::diff_to_entries`), NOT per-mutation hooks. Justification: every `run_consolidation` mutation (merge-supersede, dedup, contradiction-`invalidate`, decay) is **metadata-only on an existing row**; the only insertions are new merged rows. So the complete change set = diff of a full-enumeration snapshot taken before vs after the run. This is robust (captures whatever changed regardless of phase), needs **zero changes to the mutation sites**, and is far less error-prone than threading a recorder through 6 call sites. The pre-image embedding is reconstructed EXACTLY (not fetched — the vector store has no get-by-id) via `enrich::stored_embed_text`: raw `content`, or `compose_embed_text(content, alias_line)` when the fact is enriched-for-current-content (the `alias_line` is persisted verbatim in `metadata.enrichment.aliases`, so re-embedding reproduces the stored vector byte-for-byte; deterministic embedder).
3. **Enrichment is EXCLUDED from rollback scope.** The separate `enrich_facts` pass is additive + content-preserving (it never touches `Memory.content`; it only adds recall aliases to `metadata` + re-embeds). Undoing it would merely strip a recall boost the next run re-adds — it is not destructive, so it need not be reverted. The destructive operations (merge/dedup/contradiction/decay) ARE all captured. (Corrects the original plan's "enriched rows are 'created'" wording — enrich updates in place, it does not create rows.)
4. **CLI is a top-level `vault-cli checkpoint {list,rollback <id>}`**, NOT under `consolidate`. Rollback/list are storage-only (no models); `consolidate` requires the `--bge-*`/`--phi4-model` flags. A top-level command needs none of them — mirrors the storage-only `dead-letter` / `divergence-check` commands.

**Founder-locked carryover (2026-06-15):** capture only-changed pre-images (scales to 10k); **DEFER graph (DuckDB) rollback** until the graph enters the read path (tech-debt #2 tripwire — graph is write-only in V0.2); retention **N=7**.

**Tests:** vault-storage ×8 unit (empty-reject, create→list, rollback modified/created/mixed exact, prune-to-N, unknown-id error, double-rollback error) + migration table-existence; vault-consolidator ×2 integration every-cycle (`rollback_restores_pre_consolidation_state_exactly`, `rollback_reverts_combined_dedup_and_decay` — real BGE + MockLlm, assert post == pre EXACTLY + no-memory-lost + double-rollback guard); vault-cli ×2 parse; summary footer test updated (real id + `vault-cli checkpoint rollback` hint, replacing the `pending-T0.2.5` placeholder).

**Not chosen / deferred:** (a) per-mutation capture hooks (fragile, 6 sites); (b) a `VectorStore::get_embedding` primitive (unnecessary — reconstruction is exact); (c) rolling back enrichment (additive, self-healing — see Decision 3); (d) graph rollback (deferred, tech-debt #2).

## 8.14 · 🆕 ADR-082 (IN FLIGHT) — incremental consolidation (Pillar 2 scale fix): seed by watermark, compare against the whole corpus

**Context.** The session-5 1k pressure-test (§1 scorecard) proved a full nightly run cannot complete on this hardware — every run re-processes the WHOLE vault (re-embed all → re-cluster → re-merge → re-contradiction → re-enrich → rebuild REPORT). BRD §5.6 line 936 ALREADY specifies incremental ("for each memory **added since last consolidation**"); the shipped `since: None` full-scan was the deviation, not a new design.

**Decision.** A run is scoped by a `since` watermark — `run_consolidation(since: Option<DateTime<Utc>>)`.
- **D1** Watermark storage = a dedicated single-row `consolidation_state` table (migration `0005`), NOT the checkpoint table (which isn't written for a no-op run, so it can't reliably advance).
- **D2** Watermark value = the run's **START** time (so a fact created mid-run is picked up next run, never skipped).
- **D3** Advance the watermark **only on full-pipeline success** (`run_consolidation` → `enrich_facts` → `generate_reports` → REPORT persist). A timed-out / crashed / errored run leaves it untouched → the next run retries the same backlog. No lost work.
- **D4 (the load-bearing invariant).** Changed facts are **seeds**; each seed is compared against the **whole active corpus**. Phase 1 enumerates seeds via `since` but validates neighbour edges against ALL active ids (not the seed set); Phase 2b searches LanceDB per seed (the whole boundary). So a new fact still merges / contradiction-checks against an OLD untouched fact. Getting this wrong silently loses merge/contradiction recall — the cardinal sin — so it is gated by **R1** (clustering, `tests/incremental_consolidation.rs`) and **R2** (contradiction, `tests/contradiction_resolution.rs`).
- **D5** `since = None` stays the full-sweep path (cold start / periodic deep-clean), behaviourally unchanged (the proven A5 in-memory all-pairs path is preserved).
- **D6** A watermark read failure **fails open to a full sweep** (a slow run beats a missed merge/contradiction).
- **D7** Retired lingering vectors (superseded/invalidated/deleted, whose LanceDB vector lingers) are dropped by validating neighbours against the active-id set.

**Scope SHIPPED (session 6, this commit) — Steps 1-3:** watermark (storage migration `0005` + `consolidation_state.rs`) + incremental Phase 1 (`cluster.rs`) + incremental Phase 2b (`candidates::contradiction_candidate_neighbours` + `consolidator.rs`) + app/headless watermark wiring + R1/R2 tests. This lets a 1k nightly run COMPLETE (merge/contradiction no longer fill the 30-min budget); the only O(N) cost left is REPORT topic-discovery's embed-all (~14 min, now fits) + the one-time enrich backfill.

**Deferred (named follow-ups, NOT in this commit):**
- **Step 4** — reuse stored vectors (new `vector_store` `get_by_id`) so REPORT topic-discovery stops re-embedding the corpus → extends the win to 10k.
- **Catch-up scheduling** — on app start, if the watermark is stale (> ~24h), run once then resume nightly (the "laptop asleep at 3 AM" fix).
- **Full-sweep CLI command** + a **configurable timeout** so the one-time cold-start backfill can complete (next session, STEP 1).
- **Enrich-cap** — chunk the first-ever backfill across nights (enrich is idempotent → converges).
- **Loosen the deterministic dedup gate** (0/102 dense-template clusters caught → all hit the LLM).

**Consequences.** Nightly cost → O(facts changed), not O(vault). Trade-off: content-EDITED facts keep their `created_at`, so a `created_at`-based `since` re-enriches them (fingerprint) but does NOT re-merge / re-contradiction-check them nightly — the periodic full sweep covers that (documented V0.2 limitation).

## 8.15 · 🆕 ADR-083 (IN FLIGHT) — contradiction over-retention guard: single-valued attributes vs distinct events

**Context.** The session-7 1k diagnostic (the two cosine-distribution probes, `scale_eval::probe_contradiction_pair_distribution`) falsified BOTH proposed "1,730-pair" speed fixes: the candidate floor is already 0.70 + top-K (so the pairs are not "unpruned"), and raising it past ~0.82 drops the real Tesla/Rivian contradiction (0.823); AND the merge/dedup gate is CORRECTLY not collapsing the ≥0.92 pairs because they are **distinct facts** (different person/date/place), not duplicates — loosening it would destroy real data. The pair count is largely an artifact of pathological synthetic distractor data (`generate_distractors` template-clones), not a product defect; the nightly incremental run (the real product) is unaffected. The ONE real correctness risk surfaced (Finding B) is the **contradiction judge over-retiring distinct-but-similar facts**: the prompt taught single-valued-attribute updates (employer/city/colour) but never the difference between *"changed my city"* (supersede) and *"two separate coffee meetings"* (both true). Over-retention is the one **unrescuable** failure — a retired fact is gone from the active set; no downstream agent can recover it (the read-path "trust the agent" model does NOT apply at consolidation, where no agent is in the loop).

**Decision.** Teach the pairwise judge the single-valued-vs-event distinction in the PROMPT (guide the model, do not add a deterministic gate — honours the "trust the LLM's judgment" lock):
- **D1** A contradiction requires the shared attribute be **SINGLE-VALUED** — one the subject holds only ONE current value of (employer, city of residence, marital status, favourite colour). A new value supersedes the old → retire older.
- **D2** Facts describing distinct **EVENTS / occurrences** a person accumulates many of (meetings, trips, purchases, deliveries, tasks, messages, recaps, sign-ups, sessions) are NOT contradictions even when worded near-identically: a difference in date/day/time/place/people is the signature of two distinct events → `shared_attribute=null, contradiction=false, stale='neither'` (the existing null-shared-attribute aggregator gate is the second safety net).
- **D3** Two few-shot examples added (coffee-Monday vs coffee-Thursday; two office recaps), plus the schema `shared_attribute` description tightened to "single-valued … null if … distinct events/occurrences".

**Posture — "keep when unsure" (founder-agreed 2026-06-20).** The real-Phi-4 verification proved the prompt alone fixes the CLEAR cases but Phi-4-mini wobbles on the genuinely-ambiguous middle (5/7 on the first run: coffee + recaps fixed ✅; Berlin→Lisbon + Vega→Atlas retire ✅; "Denver — Sam vs Aisha coordinating" reassign-or-two-sessions and "Tesla→Rivian" own-two-cars are model-ceiling cases). The decision: bias hard toward KEEPING — over-retention is the one unrescuable failure (a retired fact leaves default retrieval), whereas under-retention is agent-rescuable (the read path picks current truth by `as_of`). A wins-on-the-clear-cases prompt + the existing safety nets is the right altitude; do NOT force the model to make a retire it cannot reliably make.

**Bloat answer (the question "won't keeping cause bloat?").** Keeping distinct events does NOT mean unbounded growth: clear duplicates still MERGE and clear updates still RETIRE; only the ambiguous middle is kept. Accumulated true facts are managed by **demote-not-delete** — confidence **decay** (ADR-075, BUILT: stale facts sink in ranking) + **cold-archive** (A1, DESIGNED-not-built: facts untouched ~365d leave default retrieval) + the **reranker** (read is top-K + rerank, so vault size does not linearly degrade precision). **A1 cold-archive is the named bloat follow-up** and moves up the priority list as the structural anti-bloat tool. A stronger consolidation model (BYOK/Managed only — nightly is latency-tolerant) is a pocketed option for the fuzzy-but-resolvable cases; LOCAL mode stays at Phi-4-mini (hardware-capped).

**Recall-safety.** The change can ONLY convert "contradiction → retire" into "keep both" — it strictly REDUCES retirement, so it cannot newly lose a genuine update. Verified by the real-Phi-4 `#[ignore]` probe `real_phi4_distinct_events_not_retired` (the acceptance gate, three buckets): **clear events** (coffee, recaps, Paris trips) MUST keep both [hard assert]; **clear single-valued updates** (Berlin→Lisbon, Vega→Atlas) MUST retire the older [hard assert]; **genuinely ambiguous** (Denver coordinator, Tesla→Rivian) are informational-only [printed, not asserted — neither outcome is wrong]. A MockLlm test cannot prove a prompt change, so the real-model probe IS the verification ([[feedback_runtime_confirmation_after_web_spike]]).

**Scope.** Prompt + schema-description edit in `phases/contradiction.rs` (`CONTRADICTION_PAIR_SYSTEM_PROMPT` — single-valued-vs-event principle + examples 7/8/9 + the explicit "when in doubt, keep both" instruction — `CONTRADICTION_PAIR_SCHEMA` + module doc) + the real-Phi-4 acceptance probe. No aggregator/recency logic change (the Bug-1 recency stale-pick + the null-shared-attribute gate are untouched).

**NOT in scope (explicitly).** The full-sweep pair-count "speed" — judged a test-data artifact (real vaults are not template-dense) + a one-time backfill cost the incremental feature does not pay; deferred, not fixed. Finding E (a 100-fact contradiction that did not resolve) is the *under*-retention direction — same prompt area, tracked separately; this guard does not address it. The ambiguous-middle precision ceiling is accepted, not chased (whack-a-mole against a 3.8B model); the anti-bloat burden is carried by decay + A1 archive instead.

## 8.16 · 🆕 ADR-084 (IN FLIGHT) — A1 cold archive: soft `archived_at` state, out of default retrieval, reversible

**Context.** Cold archive is the named anti-bloat tool the ADR-083 "keep when unsure" posture leans on (BRD §5.6 lines 995-996 — the other half of Phase 4, decay being the first). With over-retention now the deliberate bias, accumulated true facts need a structural demote-not-delete path so the default retrieval pool does not grow unbounded. The plumbing was already half-stubbed: `ConsolidatorConfig.archive_after_days` (default 365) and `ConsolidationReport.memories_archived` existed but the count was hard-coded `0`, and the "no memory ever lost" property (BRD §5.6 line 1023) already names **archived** as a legal third end-state alongside active and superseded.

**Decision — soft state, not a separate encrypted store (founder-agreed 2026-06-20).** BRD §5.6 line 995 says "move to cold archive (encrypted blob, removed from active stores)". We implement the *intent* (out of default retrieval, searchable via an explicit call) with a soft marker, NOT the literal separate-blob store:
- **D1** New nullable `Memory.archived_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>` (migration `0006`, column + partial index `WHERE archived_at IS NOT NULL`). `Some(t)` = cold-archived; `None` = active. A first-class state column mirroring `valid_until` / `superseded_by`, NOT a metadata-JSON hack — the property test treats archived as first-class and the consolidator filters it at SQL level. `#[serde(default)]` keeps pre-ADR-084 rollback pre-image blobs deserializable (no `CHECKPOINT_PAYLOAD_FORMAT_VERSION` bump).
- **D2** The fact stays in the already-SQLCipher-encrypted `vault.db`. A cold fact is equally unreadable to a server whether it sits in the main table with a marker or in a separate blob, so the zero-knowledge guarantee is unchanged and **no new crypto path is opened** (the separate-blob store would have — re-read §11, new key usage, new format). The separate store is a large-scale hot-index-shrink optimization deferred to V1.0+; we don't have that scale.
- **D3** Reversible by construction — archive never deletes; un-archiving is clearing the marker, and a bad nightly archive is undone by the existing checkpoint rollback (the pre-archive image restores `archived_at = None`).

**Retrieval.** Default retrieval already gated a "non-current" bucket via the single `include_archived` flag (superseded merge-losers + ADR-051 expired facts). Cold-archived facts join that same bucket — `retain(!superseded && !expired && !archived)` by default, all three surfaced when `include_archived = true` (the BRD's "explicit search archive call"). No new flag, no naming collision: `include_archived` now honestly means "include the whole archived/historical bucket". `MemoryFilter.include_archived` (default `false`) gates it at the SQL layer for the consolidator's active-set enumerations.

**Phase 4 archive pass.** New `phases/archive.rs` — pure `plan_archive(memories, archive_after_days, now)` selecting active, non-superseded, non-expired, **not-already-archived** facts idle past the threshold; applied by `Consolidator::archive_memories()` via the metadata-only `StorageBackend::apply_archive` (sets `archived_at`, emits one `memory.archived` audit event, preserves the ADR-074 enriched vector — no re-embed). Runs AFTER decay in the same Phase 4 (a fact past both thresholds is decayed AND archived this run; archive is the terminal cold state). Idempotent for free — the `archived_at` column IS the marker, and an archived fact is no longer in the `MemoryFilter::default()` active set the pass enumerates (no metadata marker needed, unlike decay). `memories_archived` and the summary "Archived: N" line now carry the real count.

**Checkpoint correctness.** The rollback diff is pre-vs-post; both snapshot reads now use `include_superseded + include_archived` so a fact this run archives (`archived_at` None → Some) is seen as **Modified** (captured for rollback), not Deleted. The run's active working set correspondingly excludes archived (`superseded_by.is_none() && !is_archived()`).

**Recall-safety / no-memory-lost.** Archive only moves facts OUT of *default* retrieval, never deletes — they remain in `vault.db` and surface via `include_archived`. The "no memory ever lost" property test (`properties.rs`) was upgraded from a two-way (active|superseded) to the full three-way partition (active|superseded|archived) per BRD §5.6 line 1023, reading post-state with both filters on.

**Scope.** `Memory.archived_at` + `is_archived()` (vault-core); migration 0006 + INSERT/UPDATE/3 SELECTs/row-decoder + `MemoryFilter.include_archived` + `apply_archive` + `memory.archived` audit event (vault-storage); `phases/archive.rs` + `archive_memories()` wiring + real `memories_archived` + summary (vault-consolidator); default-exclude filter (vault-retrieval); `include_archived` doc (vault-mcp). Tests: `plan_archive` units, `apply_archive` storage units, 2 retrieval tests (8e/8f), `archive_integration.rs` E2E (real BGE), three-state property partition, migration 0006 test.

**NOT in scope (explicitly).** The literal separate encrypted archive store (V1.0+ scale optimization, D2). A user-facing MCP "search archive" tool — the storage + retrieval plumbing supports it today (`include_archived: true`); exposing a dedicated MCP surface is a small follow-up. Removing archived vectors from the LanceDB hot index (they stay, filtered post-search — the index-shrink is the deferred separate-store win).

Full rules in `~/.claude/projects/C--Projects-GitHub-Memory-Vault/memory/`.

- **Confirm before every commit + push.** One combined approval covers both; per-action (yes-commit ≠ yes-push for the *next* task). Co-Authored-By: bare `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`, no model qualifier.
- **CI green per-commit.** Every code commit shows CI green matrix-wide (`gh run list --workflow=ci.yml -L 1`) before staging the next. Local DoD ≠ CI green. Relaxation is the founder's to invoke per-batch, acknowledged in the commit body.
- **Confirm before any cargo build/test/clippy/check/run + check disk first** (laptop freezes during compile; disk runs tight). Report disk + target size in the ask. Only `cargo fmt` is safe. Run gates in background (`run_in_background=true`).
- **Strictly-serial cargo.** Never parallel cargo on the same workspace (kills incremental cache → 30GB+ wipe + 30-min rebuild). Order: check → test → clippy → fmt → `git status`.
- **Cargo on Windows = PowerShell** (Strawberry Perl path order for the sqlcipher/openssl vendoring; MSYS2 perl in Bash lacks the modules). Set `LIBCLANG_PATH` + prepend to PATH each fresh shell.
- **fmt runs LAST**, with `git status --short` between final `cargo fmt --all --check` and `git add` to catch drift (esp. `Cargo.lock`).
- **Admin-only changes ride with the next code commit** (HANDOFF/ADR/tech-debt/doc edits never get their own commit — saves a ~45-min CI cycle). Spike examples + eval harnesses + baselines bundle with the tested code that consumes them, never alone.
- **No drive-by refactoring.** Log it under Tech Debt (§7) and continue.
- **Surface plan amendments BEFORE code** (recon-class changes, signature changes, new primitives, floor-forecast breaches). Inline architectural decisions produce an ADR in the same commit.
- **Plain English when asking the founder questions** (non-coder product owner); reserve technical density for code/commits/ADRs/HANDOFF.
- **Never commit the project-level CLAUDE.md** (gitignored, local-only).
- **HANDOFF line "Last updated" is a lagging indicator.** For current-state questions, source-read §1 + cross-check `git log --oneline`.
- **Definition of Done (BRD §0.1):** build zero-warnings + affected-crate tests pass + clippy `-D warnings` clean + `fmt --check` passes + HANDOFF updated. All five or it's not done.

## 13 · 🧪 Full-aspect live test campaign — scorecard + failure root-causes (2026-06-11)

Driven via a scripted MCP **stdio** client (`C:\Projects\mcp-probe\client.py`, NOT in repo) against `seeded-vault-mixed` (~94 messy+clean dogfood facts) + `seeded-vault-tiny` (6-fact consolidation demo). Antigravity quota was down so I acted as the MCP client directly (the structured contract the agent receives). **No production code changed.**

| Aspect | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Write / Read / Update / Delete | ✅ | CRUD round-trip: write→read→update(content replaced)→delete(gone) |
| Search + recall-safety + `weak_match` | ✅ | never empty (even nonsense query → n=5, `weak_match=true`); `weak_match=false` only on real hits |
| Access control — reject unauthorized | ✅ | write to `secret` → `{-32001, "access denied"}` |
| Access control — accept authorized | ✅ | write to `testeval` → id returned |
| Boundary isolation | ✅ | `testeval` marker visible w/ testeval authorized, invisible w/ personal-only (n=10) |
| Encryption at rest — `vault.db` | ✅ | header = random bytes, not `SQLite format 3` (SQLCipher) |
| Graph encryption — `graph.duckdb` | ❌/⚠️ | `DUCK` magic = PLAINTEXT (tech-debt #7) |
| Merge / dedup | ✅ | tiny vault: 2 near-dup run-facts → 1, both originals superseded |
| REPORT (structured knowledge state) | ✅ | `personal.report.json` 4 auto-named topics, dates captured |
| Enrichment (Gap-2 recall lift) | ✅ | 1k MCP A/B (Porto ABSENT→1) + tiny-vault consolidate (4 enriched, 0 failed) |
| Abstain — clear absence (cat) | ✅ | `abstain=true`, surfaces dog Biscuit, invents no cat |
| Abstain — salary | ❌ | `abstain=false`, surfaces "$450 room booking" (conf 0.41) |
| Abstain — blood type / OS | ⚠️ | `abstain=false` but top_rel ~0.01–0.02 (marginal) |
| Wrong-neighbor precision | ⚠️ | distractor ranks #1: live→"mother in Lisbon", kids→"Marcus's kids", allergy→"Marcus's peanut" |
| Contradiction **resolution** | ⚠️ | Tesla/Rivian both stay active (0 resolved, 0 queued) even with `as_of` set |
| Decay / archive | ❌ | not built (T0.2.4) |

**One-line root-cause per non-pass item:**
- **Graph plaintext** — ADR-010's DuckDB encryption layer (scoped T0.2.0) never actually shipped; the store still opens plaintext (runtime still WARNs). Low risk only because the graph is empty in V0.2 (entity extraction unbuilt, tech-debt #2).
- **Salary $-trap** — the reranker scores money-shaped facts ("$450 booking", "rent 1200") as relevant to "salary" and there is no per-candidate category/precision filter to veto a confident wrong-category match; the abstain gate is purely reranker-score-driven and the score cleared the no-signal floor.
- **Blood/OS marginal abstain** — the no-signal floor (~0.01) sits just below where a couple of barely-related distractors score (0.011–0.019), so they squeak over and `abstain` stays false even though nothing relevant exists.
- **Wrong-neighbor #1 ordering** — the reranker ranks a semantically-adjacent fact about *someone/something else* (the mother, Marcus, the dog) above the user's own fact; there is no subject/ownership signal distinguishing "about the user" from "about an associate."
- **Contradiction not resolved** — NN-pair + Phi-4 judge did not flag Tesla vs Rivian as a contradiction (two cars can coexist / pair not surfaced), and `as_of` is write-time so there is no fact-time recency signal to force supersession; both remain active.
- **Decay/archive** — simply not implemented yet (Phase 4 / T0.2.4 never started; `memories_archived` returns 0).

**Verdict:** storage / retrieval / security / structural plumbing is **correct on messy data**; every gap is in the **precision/abstain** layer (read-precision arc, roadmap §5 item 1) or **temporal resolution** (`as_of`/A5) or **unbuilt nightly features** (decay/archive). Wave 3 (live Flash vs Pro on `seeded-vault-mixed`) is the remaining acceptance — does a real agent land the right answer from this structured output.

## 13.1 · 🧪 Wave 3 — DONE (live Flash + Opus 4.6 in Antigravity, 2026-06-12)

Live-agent run on `seeded-vault-mixed` (un-enriched). **Both models landed correct answers on essentially every trap** — the agent layer rescues a genuinely messy vault ranking. No code changed; CI stays green on `d613614`.

- **Gemini Flash (weak):** 14/15 atomic clean + 1 expected temporal partial (car: listed Tesla+Rivian, didn't resolve). On a multi-intent *sentence* Flash **mashed all 4 intents into one query** (`"languages sports teams reading holiday"`, top_relevance 0.040) → McLaren + The Expanse **buried out of the result window** → answer complete but **partly papered over with lucky-correct guesses**.
- **Claude Opus 4.6 (strong):** **decomposed** the same sentence into 4 focused `memory_search` calls → fully grounded, fully correct, both category traps held (Blade Runner out of "reading", Madrid framed as work not holiday), even synthesized accurate cross-links (Portuguese↔Porto, City↔Manchester from the wide recall pools).

**Probe replay — vault-level ground truth (raw `memory_read`, natural-question GRADE_QUERIES, agent stripped away).** Only **2 of 10 traps are vault-clean** (cat→abstain=True@0.25; instrument→cello #1@0.98). The other 8 are messy at the source:
- **Wrong-neighbour #1 at high confidence (0.88–0.99):** "where do you live" → **#1 = mother/Lisbon (0.99)**, Porto not even top-5; "have kids" → #1 = Marcus's kids (0.88), twins #3; "allergic" → #1 = Marcus's peanut (0.95), user's penicillin/shellfish #2/#3. The reranker confidently ranks an *associate's* fact above the user's own.
- **Salary trap fires at vault level:** abstain=False, #1 = "$450 booking" (0.41). Flash/Opus both rescued by reasoning from self-describing content.
- **Marginal abstain misses:** blood-type top 0.011, OS top 0.019 — both squeak over the `READ_NO_SIGNAL_FLOOR` 0.01, abstain stays False.
- **Contradiction unresolved:** car → Tesla(0.997)+Rivian both active, no supersession (`as_of` is write-time).

**Two findings (1 kept, 1 retracted):**
1. **KEPT — reranker brittle on terse keyword queries.** Natural questions score 0.88–0.99; terse fragments collapse to noise (Opus's `"sports teams follow"` → top 0.0022, "supports manchester city" ranked **#8 below junk**). Two query-style failure modes both → noise: weak-agent *mash* (dilution, facts buried) + strong-agent *keyword-strip* (facts present, ranked below noise). Fix = steer agents to **decompose AND phrase as natural questions** (`instructions.md` follow-up, §4). Memory: [[project_reranker_brittle_on_terse_queries]].
2. **RETRACTED — `search_hint.rs` weak_match is NOT buggy.** A mid-run hypothesis that `weak_match=false` on a noise-level separated top needed the ADR-073 no-signal floor was **falsified by a code read**: the separation-based (not magnitude) design is deliberate and documented (canonical example "cello 0.0469"), and `weak_match=false` is honest because matches genuinely exist in the pool. Do not change it.

**Net:** outcomes are good on both model tiers, but the **vault's ranking is genuinely messy** — the agent rescue is a crutch (a model weaker than Flash would faceplant on salary/allergy). This is the strongest evidence yet for **roadmap §5 item 1 (read precision): a subject/ownership signal so "about the user" beats "about an associate" + a category veto for the salary-shape trap.** Recall-safety ([[project_memory_read_primary_search_recall_safe]]) is the hero that makes the messy ranking survivable. The Gap-2 enrichment lift was NOT exercised here (mixed vault un-enriched); optionally enrich it (surgical `enrich_one` loop) to also test Porto-in-soup.

### 13.2 · Gap #4 (car/temporal) — ADR-075 fact-time SPIKED + REVERTED 2026-06-12; route to agent-steering, not vault resolution

Attempted Arc B (gap #4): a consolidation-time Phi-4 **fact-time extractor** (Option B, vault-owned; new `phases/fact_time.rs` + `effective_fact_time` recency input + Phase-2b wiring) to break the write-time recency tie that leaves Tesla+Rivian both active. Scaffolded, compiled clean (0 warnings), and **gated on a real-Phi-4 end-to-end spike** (`real_phi4_car_resolution`) **before any commit**. Spike result (110s) — **the car does NOT cleanly auto-resolve, for two independent reasons:**
1. **The conservative judge correctly refuses.** Real Phi-4 returned `contradiction=false` / `stale=[]` for "Drives a Tesla Model 3." + "Finally picked up my Rivian R1T last month." — owning two cars is genuinely possible; the judge only flags with an explicit replacement signal ("having sold the Tesla"), which the real content lacks. Making it more aggressive risks wrongly retiring coexisting facts (recall cardinal sin).
2. **The date-less old fact inverts recency.** Phi-4 DID extract the Rivian's "last month" → 2026-05-11 correctly, but the Tesla (no date in its text) falls back to write-time (today) → it looks *newer* than the Rivian → recency would retire the **wrong** (Rivian) car. `effective_fact_time`'s write-time fallback is unreliable for mixed dated/undated pairs.

**Decision (Shahbaz): reverted the scaffold; do NOT force vault-side car resolution.** This is the genuinely-ambiguous case the agent-decides lock ([[project_architectural_lock_llm_out_of_read_path]]) is *for* — both Flash & Opus presented both cars correctly above. **Re-route gap #4 to agent-steering** (the car steer, bundled with the gap-#7 terse-query steer — both landed this session as MCP tool-description edits, NOT an `instructions.md`: no such file exists; the tool descriptions are the cross-platform lever per [[project_mcp_descriptions_cross_platform_lever]]). Cheap, safe, no recall risk. The fact-time *extraction tech works* (Phi-4 nailed the relative date) — it's just the wrong lever for this case; the agent-settable `as_of` (2026-05-30 decision) remains the safe write-time path for explicit dates. Spiking caught this in 110s, before a build+commit+live-test cycle. Arc B code reverted (working tree back to CI-green `d613614` for the consolidator). Memory: [[project_as_of_write_time_blocks_a5_temporal]] (UPDATE 2026-06-12).

### 13.3 · 🆕 Gap-table reclassification (2026-06-12, Shahbaz) — NO confirmed-broken output; #1/#2 are insurance, not must-fix

**The reframe (Shahbaz caught the inconsistency):** Wave 3 showed the agent produces CORRECT OUTPUT on *every* tested trap — salary, allergy, wrong-neighbour, instrument, car. So the same logic that closed the car (#4 — "agent handles it, don't force a vault fix") applies to #1/#2/#3 too. They were over-stated as "must-fix." **By the founder thesis (correctness of OUTPUT is the product) there is NO confirmed-broken item in the gap table.** Distinction that survives: #4 (car) has *no single correct answer* (ambiguous → fixing is *wrong*); #1/#2 *have* a correct answer the vault mis-ranks (fixing is *safe* — reorder-only, no deletion — but *not urgent* since output is already correct).

| # | Gap | Output correct today? | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Wrong-neighbour #1 ranking | ✅ agent rescues | 🟡 **Insurance** | Build only if a correct fact gets truncated out of the agent's ~20-candidate view at scale, OR to harden Managed-mode (unknown weak agents). Measured at vault level §13.1. Roadmap §5.1. |
| 2 | Salary $-trap | ✅ agent rescues | 🟡 **Insurance** | Same arc as #1. |
| 3 | Blood/OS marginal abstain | ✅ agent handles | 🅿️ **Parked** | Tightening the floor risks killing real low-score answers; recall lock wins. |
| 4 | Car / contradiction | ✅ agent shows both | ✅ **Decided — agent-steer** | Ambiguous; fact-time spiked + reverted (§13.2). Steer SHIPPED-pending-gates this session. |
| 5 | `graph.duckdb` plaintext | n/a | 🟢 **Low-pri** | Fold into Pillar 3 (sync) security review; graph empty in V0.2. |
| 6 | Decay / archive | n/a | 🟢 **Planned build** | Part of Pillar 2 (T0.2.4) — not separate work. |
| 7 | Reranker brittle on terse queries | ✅ Opus decomposed | 🟠 **Steer SHIPPED-pending-gates** | MCP tool-description edits this session (staged uncommitted). |

**Pillar reclassification:** Pillar 1 (read precision = #1/#2) **de-prioritised to insurance** — was "the #1 arc," downgraded today because output is already correct via the agent. Pillars 2 (consolidator auto-run — has the ~90-fact hardware wall), 3 (sync), 4 (beta/daily-use) unchanged. **Product call pending:** keep hardening (insurance) vs pivot to real daily dogfood (lean: dogfood-first, the core produces correct output and is ready to *use*).

**Working-tree state at this close:** (a) `crates/vault-mcp/src/server.rs` — gap-#7 + car steer tool-description edits, **staged, NOT gated/committed** (Shahbaz: gates tomorrow bundled with more code). (b) `HANDOFF.md` — this update. (c) Consolidator Arc B fully reverted (matches `d613614`). (d) Out-of-repo: memory `project_as_of_write_time_blocks_a5_temporal` UPDATE + NEW `project_reranker_brittle_on_terse_queries` + MEMORY.md index line. CI still green on `d613614`; next commit must gate the server.rs change + CI-verify.
