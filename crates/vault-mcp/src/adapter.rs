//! `Adapter` trait — domain-level boundary between the MCP wire protocol
//! (JSON-RPC stdio handled by [`crate::server::StdioServer`]) and the vault
//! crates that actually do the work (`vault-retrieval` for search,
//! `vault-storage` for write / update / delete).
//!
//! ## Trust boundary (ADR-025)
//!
//! Every method takes the request shape directly (a `RetrievalQuery` for
//! search, a `NewMemory` for write, etc.). The authorization input — the
//! `authorized_boundaries` field on `RetrievalQuery` and the per-method
//! parameters — is set by [`StdioServer`](crate::server::StdioServer) from
//! its trusted state, never from request-body parsing. The Adapter
//! implementor MUST NOT re-derive boundaries from the request shape.
//!
//! Phase 1 (T0.1.9) lands the trait + a stub implementation that returns
//! `unimplemented!()` for every method. Phase 2 lands the real impl in
//! `vault-app` (or a sibling `VaultAdapter` type — TBD at T0.1.10) that
//! holds `Arc<MetadataStore>` + `Arc<dyn Retriever>` + `Arc<StorageBackend>`
//! and dispatches accordingly.
